"Olugbenga Edema dumps APC, elected NNPP governorship candidate in Ondo",https://www.thecable.ng/olugbenga-edema-dumps-apc-elected-nnpp-governorship-candidate-in-ondo/,TheCable,"Olugbenga Edema, a former governorship aspirant of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Ondo, has defected to the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP).

The state governorship election is slated to take place on November 16.

In April, allegations of irregularities trailed the conduct of the APC primary election in the state, which resulted in the victory of Lucky Aiyedatiwa as the party’s flagbearer.

Edema was among the party’s aspirants who kicked and alleged that the election didn’t take place in most parts of the state.

Edema announced his exit from the ruling party on Wednesday in Akure, the state capital, and was subsequently elected as the substitution candidate for the NNPP ahead of the governorship election.
Prior to the event, Ayeni Oluwatosin, then NNPP governorship candidate, had voluntarily withdrawn his candidacy from the election.
In a letter, Oluwatosin said his withdrawal was in the interest of the party.
“I, Ayeni, Oluwatosin Israel, a governorship candidate of the NNPP for the November 16, 2024, election in Ondo State, hereby voluntarily withdraw my candidacy from the contest. My withdrawal is in the best interest of our great party, NNPP,” the letter reads.

Police arrest ‘ex-convict posing as military officer’ in Akwa Ibom,https://www.thecable.ng/police-arrest-ex-convict-posing-as-military-officer-in-akwa-ibom/,TheCable,"The police command in Akwa Ibom has arrested Eddiong Matthew for impersonating a military officer.
Timfon John, spokesperson for the police command, said operatives on crime prevention patrol arrested the 35-year-old suspect on Thursday.
The spokesperson said preliminary investigations revealed that the suspect is an ex-convict linked to a series of crimes in the state using a military uniform.
John said a walkie-talkie, cell phones, a brown coverall dress, and ID cards suspected to have been stolen from victims were recovered from him.
The spokesperson said the suspect would be charged in court as soon as investigations are concluded.

"JUST IN: I remain LP member, says Obi amid ‘Obidients directorate’ controversy",https://www.thecable.ng/just-in-i-remain-lp-member-says-obi-amid-obidients-directorate-controversy/,TheCable,"Peter Obi, presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP) in the 2023 elections, says he remains committed to the party.
On Wednesday, Obi criticised the decision of the party to appoint directors to coordinate the registration of all members of the ‘Obedient’ community and “integrate them fully into the structure of the party”.
He said the “Obidient movement” is not a directorate of any political party.
The party subsequently announced that it has renamed the “Obidient directorate” to the directorate of mobilisation and integration.
In a statement shared on X on Thursday, the former governor of Anambra said he is a loyal party member working towards reconciling disgruntled members to the party.
“For the avoidance of doubt, ‘I remain a committed, Loyal Labour Party member’. That is my definitive response to all Nigerians who may be in doubt about my party affiliation in the light of recent reports and conflicting interpretations of recent political expressions,” Obi wrote.
“I remain a faithful, committed and loyal member of the Labour Party. Indeed as a Leader of the party, my aspiration, and desire to work closely with other Leaders is to reconcile our valued members, and partner with like minds and parties all over the country to build a strong and better Party that will catalyze and commence the rebuilding of a new Nigeria.
“My statement yesterday was intended to clarify some issues that are of concern to our teeming supporters some of whom are not members of any political party but are desirous for a new Nigeria.”

"‘Without workers, no work can take place’ — labour defends shutting down national grid",https://www.thecable.ng/without-workers-no-work-can-take-place-labour-defends-shutting-down-national-grid/,TheCable,"The Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) has defended its decision to shut down the national grid as part of the ongoing nationwide indefinite strike over the new minimum wage.
On Friday, the NLC and the Trade Union Congress (TUC) declared an indefinite strike over the federal government’s refusal to increase the minimum wage.
The strike commenced on Monday with total compliance by all government institutions across the country.
As a result, the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) said the labour union shut down the national grid at about 2:19 am, resulting in a blackout across the country.
Ndidi Mbah, TCN’s general manager, said workers at the Benin Transmission Operator were sent away from the control room and beaten by the protesters.
In a statement issued on the shutting down of the national grid, Joe Ajaero, president of the NLC, said the federal government has abused workers’ restraint.
“It is important that we address the press statement by the Transmission Company of Nigeria where they made false claims regarding the indefinite nationwide strike declared by the Nigeria Labour Congress and Trade Union Congress,” the statement reads.
“The Transmission Company of Nigeria should understand that the company is not the only one impacted by the massive withdrawal of service across the nation by Nigerian workers.
“It should therefore not make it a TCN affair, as other organisations also suffer from one breakdown in service or the other as a result of the nationwide industrial action.
“The management of TCN ought to have realised that the NLC and TUC issued a notice to the Federal Government since the beginning of May 2024 on the issues of non-completion of the National Minimum Wage negotiation exercise and passage into law and the vexatious hike in electricity tariff.
“We had demanded the completion of the wage-setting process and a reversal of the hike in the electricity tariff back to N66/kWh without any positive response from the government.
“One wonders whether TCN’s management needs education on the dynamics of industrial action. It is not true that we manhandled anybody in any TCN location.
“Maybe TCN, in its effort to scuttle the strike, tried to force workers to be at work, not realising the resolve of all workers to stay away. Why would the grid not go down when the workers who operate them decide to withdraw their service? That is how it works, and it further demonstrates that without workers, no wheel can turn and no work can take place anywhere.
“Nigerian workers, led by the NLC and TUC, have exercised due caution and unusual patience in our engagement with our social partners, and this restraint has been grossly abused, unfortunately, which has led us to the present impasse.
“Trying to buck-pass instead of accepting blame and taking the necessary steps to put its house in order will not allow the Transmission Company of Nigeria to make discernible progress.
“We would like the organisation to take adequate measures to ensure that it discharges its responsibilities to Nigerians, especially in the electricity sector, instead of dissipating its energy on trying to insult Nigerian workers by its deliberate peddling of falsehood.
“We have been duly informed that the TCN management has resorted to the use of the military in its effort to intimidate and harass workers in its employ who are carrying out their lawful and democratic duties at various TCN plants around Nigeria.”
Ajaero said the management of TCN would be held liable for any injury inflicted on any worker by its resort to the use of the powers of the military.
“It is also important that we inform TCN that deploying military men to its locations is a clear abuse and insult to the military, especially in a democracy,” the NLC president said.
“We are sure that members of the military so misused by this deployment are not happy with the management and the authorities who have authorised the deployment.
“The NLC and TUC remain steadfast in their commitment to the emancipation of downtrodden Nigerians and will persist in the struggle for a fair and just living wage, as well as the reversal of the excessive electricity tariff hike.
“We call on all Nigerians to stand in solidarity with us as we demand the implementation of policies that prioritize the well-being of the people. We will not back down, and we will not give in to any blackmail, intimidation, or harassment.”

"Troops ‘rescue’ 33 hostages, ‘kill six terrorists’ in Sambisa forest",https://www.thecable.ng/troops-rescue-33-hostages-kill-six-terrorists-in-sambisa-forest/,TheCable,"Troops of operation Hadin Kai in Borno state have killed six suspected terrorists and rescued 33 hostages in the Sambisa forest.
Zagazola Makama, a counter-insurgency publication focused on the Lake Chad region, reports that the rescued people comprise one male adult, three female adults, and 29 children.
A source who spoke with the publication said the combined troops of 21 armoured brigade and special forces, assisted by a hybrid force and the civilian joint task force (CJTF), raided the terrorists’ enclaves on May 29.
“The offensive was launched under operation Desert Sanity III and achieved a spectacular victory on May 29, 2024, when they invaded the Boko Haram/ISWAP enclaves of Parisu and Aulari in the Forest,” Zagazola quoted a military source as saying.
“Contact was made with the terrorists, which resulted in a heavy gun battle.
“The troops overwhelmed the terrorists and neutralised them instantly, while others escaped with bullet wounds.”
The troops also recovered weapons used by the fleeing terrorists, including AK-47 rifles.
Meanwhile, on Thursday, Samuel Aruwan, commissioner for internal security in Kaduna, said the troops of the Nigerian Army of division 1 and operation Whirl Punch killed six terrorists and arrested three others in a special operation in Giwa LGA of the state.

IPOB lawyer to south-east governors: Declare May 30 as public holiday,https://www.thecable.ng/ipob-lawyer-to-south-east-governors-declare-may-30-as-public-holiday/,TheCable,"Ifeanyi Ejiofor, lead counsel of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), has implored governors of states in the south-east to declare May 30 as public holiday in commemoration of ‘Biafra Day’.
On May 30, 1967, Chukwuemeka Ojukwu, former governor of the eastern region, declared secession of Biafra Republic from Nigeria.
The declaration led to the civil war that started on July 6, 1967, and ended on January 15, 1970.
In a statement issued on Thursday, Ejiofor said the governors of the five states in the south-east should set aside May 30 in honour of fallen Biafran soldiers. 
Ejiofor added that the federal government should “unconditionally release genuine Biafran agitators who are being held in various detention facilities” across the country.
He said this would go a long way in moderating the resentment of the “marginalised Biafrans” and would help restore a sense of reintegration in the Nigerian project.
“May 30th is set aside as a special day to remember and reflect on the death of over five million Biafrans who were genocidally massacred during the three-year Biafra-Nigeria war, which lasted from July 6, 1967 to January 15, 1970,” he said.


“This day is dedicated to honouring our fallen heroes and heroines, not only to remember the cause for which they were brutally killed but also to reflect on how their deaths have impacted the lives of Biafrans, the lessons learned, and the resolutions made since then.
“I use this moment of sober reflection to call on all south-east governors to dedicate May 30th as a public holiday, as a mark of respect and honour for Biafran fallen heroes.
“It is not asking too much to remember and commemorate Biafran heroes and heroines by declaring this date a public holiday across Biafraland.”
Roads were deserted across the south-east on Thursday, May 30, 2024, after IPOB ordered a sit-at-home in the region.

PHOTOS: Hunters stand guard as Sanusi remains in palace despite court order ,https://www.thecable.ng/photos-hunters-stand-guard-as-sanusi-remains-in-palace-despite-court-order/,TheCable,"Security agents, including police officers, hunters, and vigilantes, are standing guard at the palace of the Emir of Kano.
On Thursday, Abba Yusuf, governor of Kano, announced the reinstatement of Muhammadu Sanusi as the Emir of Kano.
Yusuf reinstated Sanusi shortly after he signed the bill abolishing the five emirates created in 2019.
In March 2020, Abdullahi Ganduje, former governor of Kano, deposed Sanusi as Emir of Kano “for total disrespect to lawful instructions from the office of the governor”.
On Thursday, the state legislators passed the amended Kano State Emirate Council (Repeal) Bill 2024.
The new emirate law stipulated the sack of all the emirs in the jurisdictions and a restoration of the old order.
Only one Emir will now be overseeing all of Kano.
With the announcement, the governor dethroned Aminu Ado Bayero, who was away in Ogun state on an official assignment, as the Emir.
The development has created tension in Kano.
When TheCable visited the Emir’s palace on Saturday night, the security details of the governor were seen there.
It was believed that the governor, some commissioners, and other political appointees were with the new Emir at the time of this report.
On his return to the state on Saturday, the deposed Emir moved into another palace in Nassarawa LGA.
The place was heavily guarded by men of the Nigerian Army, operatives of the Department of State Services (DSS), and police officers at the time of the visit by TheCable.
The former Emir’s official car was spotted as his supporters trooped into the mini palace to pay homage.

Imo chief judge: Nigerians losing confidence in judiciary,https://www.thecable.ng/imo-chief-judge-nigerians-losing-confidence-in-judiciary/,TheCable,"Theresa Chikeka, the chief judge of Imo, says citizens are losing confidence in the nation’s judiciary.
Speaking during the second law week of the Mbano-Etiti branch of the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) held on Friday, the judge said the public perception of the judiciary is depreciating.
The chief judge was represented at the event by L. C. Azuama.
“I feel concerned about the downward swing of our judicial system, especially as it has to do with the perception of the populace,” she said.
“The judiciary, being the last hope of the common man, ought to maintain such confidence reposed in it by the populace as indeed its mouthpiece.
“In the eyes of the public, the judiciary may have failed, but the question is if we are ready to rediscover and redeem its image by assuring all Nigerians that all hope is not lost.”
Chikeka said despite the challenges facing the judiciary, the institution is filled with brilliant professionals who could make a permanent difference.
Earlier this month, Peter Obi, presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP) in the 2023 elections, said the judiciary is the biggest threat to the nation’s democracy.
The former Anambra governor added that justice in Nigeria “goes to the highest bidder” and has become “commodified”.

Datti Baba-Ahmed to Soyinka: Obi can’t control ‘Obidients’ — respect yourself first,https://www.thecable.ng/datti-baba-ahmed-to-soyinka-obi-cant-control-obidients-respect-yourself-first/,TheCable,"Datti Baba-Ahmed, vice-presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP) in the 2023 election, has taken umbrage at the remarks of Wole Soyinka, the Nobel laureate.
Baba-Ahmed said Soyinka’s comments on Peter Obi, presidential candidate of the LP in the last poll, should be dismissed as a distraction.
In an interview with Noble Eyisi, Soyinka said Obi should not vie for the presidency in 2027 because he is “unfit” to lead Nigeria.
Soyinka had accused Obi of encouraging the online vitriol often lobbed by his supporters — who are called ‘Obidients’.
In an interview on Arise Television, Baba-Ahmed said the Nobel laureate should rather respect himself instead of waiting for Obi to control the actions of his supporters.
The former senator said Obi would not join issues with Soyinka, adding that “intellect does not give one a right to insult anybody”.
“The learned elder statesman is scared in advance about what good Peter Obi would bring to Nigeria. He’s scared that the end is looking very likely for his principal, for bad governance,” Baba-Ahmed said.
“What Soyinka is doing now is an attempted distraction. 
“Nobel laureates all over the world are loved and cherished by their people, not just their nationals but globally. I have never heard where Nobel laureates are insulted in the way that Wole Soyinka is. 
“There is no way Peter Obi, with all the issues in front of him and my humble self, can control Obidients.
“Peter Obi entered a canoe without a life jacket and he paid for it. It is not the work of Peter Obi to control the Obidients, it is the responsibility of Wole Soyinka to maintain his respect and dignity.
“In the presence of all these politics, decent Nigerians should continue to offer respect to others.
“All he is trying to do is an attempted distraction which Peter Obi and I have excused ourselves from. We will not react to that Nobel laureate.
“What is Wole Soyinka at a time when the Nigerian armed forces are killing Nigerians by mistake? At a time when our currency is hopelessly depreciating and so many other issues.”
In 2023, Soyinka accused Baba-Ahmed of “fascistic language” and “threatening the judiciary” after the LP vice-presidential candidate said Bola Tinubu would be leading an unconstitutional government if sworn in as president.
Baba-Ahmed had maintained that the APC candidate did not “meet requirements of the law”.

Soyinka: I’ve never heard anyone threaten the judiciary on TV the way Datti did,https://www.thecable.ng/soyinka-ive-never-heard-anyone-threaten-the-judiciary-on-tv-the-way-datti-did/,TheCable,"Wole Soyinka, the Nobel laureate, has described the comments by Datti Baba-Ahmed, vice-presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP), in a recent interview as containing “fascistic language”.
Soyinka spoke in a chat with Arise TV on Wednesday.
On March 22, Datti, in an interview with Channels TV, said the country has no president-elect despite the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) announcing Bola Tinubu of the All Progressives Congress (APC) as the winner of the election.
The LP vice-presidential candidate said Tinubu would be leading an unconstitutional government if sworn into office because the APC candidate “has not met requirements of the law”.
The interview has elicited criticism from political stakeholders as well as a N5 million fine for the TV station.
Adding his voice to the conversation, Soyinka described Datti’s remarks as a “kind of do-or-die attitude and provocation” that goes contrary to democratic disposition.
He said the LP vice-presidential candidate tried to “dictate to the supreme arbiter of the nation”, adding that it was unacceptable.
“I have never heard anyone threaten the judiciary on television the way Datti did. I heard the kind of menacing, blackmailing language as that to which we were treated by Datti. That kind of do-or-die attitude and provocation is not what I think we have all been struggling for,” Soyinka said.
“Nearly the totality of Datti’s comment in the interview was unbecoming. It was like trying to dictate to the supreme arbiter of the nation, and whatever you think of the supreme court, it is an institution we all refer to sooner or later.
“But Datti kept saying, in his wisdom, that the supreme court must agree with me. That is what is known as fascistic language and it is not acceptable.”
‘FAKE NEWS ATTRIBUTED TO ME’
The Nobel laureate has been one of the most prominent victims of fake news in the country in recent years.
The latest was a viral social media post which claimed he endorsed Tinubu during the run-up to the presidential election.
Reacting to what he called “nauseating and praise-singing tracts”, Soyinka announced a $1000 reward for “anyone who can finger successfully the author of some of the tracts which have been attributed to me over the past six months”.
“Please beware of fake news. A lot of damage is being done by fake news. Even as recently as a few days ago. Some garbage, verbiage, nauseating and praise-singing tracts which we have seen so many times before have been resurrected and attributed to Wole Soyinka. It makes me sick. If people want to be praise singers let them do it in their own father’s name and leave Soyinka out of it,” he said.
“I want to use this opportunity to announce a reward of $1000 to anyone who can finger successfully the author of some of the tracts which have been attributed to me over the past six months.”

Datti to CJN: Don’t swear in Tinubu | There’s no president-elect for now,https://www.thecable.ng/datti-to-cjn-dont-swear-in-tinubu-theres-no-president-elect-for-now/,TheCable,"Datti Baba-Ahmed, the vice-presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP), says Bola Tinubu did not meet the constitutional requirements to become Nigeria’s president.
Speaking on Wednesday in an interview on Channels Television, Baba-Ahmed said Tinubu failed to fulfill the requirements stipulated in the section of the 1999 constitution (as amended) for election to the office of the president.
On March 1, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) declared Tinubu as the winner of the February 25 presidential election.
Tinubu, the candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), scored 8,794,726 votes and secured the 25 percent threshold of total votes in 30 states of the federation but failed to have the threshold in votes cast in the federal capital territory (FCT).
Section 134 (2) of the 1999 constitution says: “A candidate for an election to the office of President shall be deemed to have been duly elected where, there being more than two candidates for the election: (a) he has the highest number of votes cast at the election; and (b) he has not less than one-quarter of the votes cast at the election in each of at least two-thirds of all the States in the Federation and the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja.
The declaration of Tinubu as the President-elect despite not getting 25 percent of the votes cast in FCT has continued to generate debates.
Speaking on the development,  Baba-Ahmed said swearing in Tinubu as president is “ending democracy” and a clear violation of the 1999 constitution.
He asked Olukayode Ariwoola, the chief justice of Nigeria (CJN), not to participate in the swearing-in of Tinubu as president over what he described as a “violation” of the constitution.
“Section 134 stipulates who should be declared and issued a certificate of return. It is only that candidate that has scored the highest number of votes and at least 25 percent each in at least two-thirds of the states of the federation and the FCT,” he said.
“Now, it is very clear that Tinubu does not have 25 percent in the FCT, we denied him. We got 61 percent. Atiku does not have 25 percent in the FCT. We denied both of them.
“By clear and unambiguous provisions of the Nigerian constitution, which must not be breached, Tinubu has not satisfied the requirement to be declared President-elect. Accordingly, there is no President-elect for Nigeria now. Because the declared one violates the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and I know what I’m saying.
“Swearing in a ticket that has not met the constitutional requirement is ending democracy. That is indeed the correct interpretation. You cannot swear in people who have not met the constitutional requirement. if you do it, you have done something unlawful and unconstitutional.
“Mr President, do not hold that inauguration. CJN, your lordship, do not participate in unconstitutionality. It is extreme and I’m saying it. It was more extreme for Yakubu to issue that certificate. It was reckless.”

On Monday, gunmen attacked Zurak village in Wase LGA of the state and reportedly killed more than 40 residents.
Obi described the latest killings as one too many, and asked the federal government to live up to its constitutional responsibility of protecting lives and property. 
“One continues to be disheartened by the persistent reports of terrorist attacks across Plateau, Benue, and other parts of the country,” the former Anambra governor wrote on X.
“The recent reports of an attack in Zurak village in Wase LGA of Plateau state which has left about 40 people dead and many others hospitalized remains a very sad one, which must be condemned in strong terms. 
“This adds to the growing number of these heinous attacks. These repeated attacks particularly in Plateau have become too many to make any discerning mind worrisome.
“Again, I call on the government to rise to its responsibilities of securing the lives and property of Nigerians with corresponding actions.
“Above all, we must take every necessary measure to drastically reduce insecurity in the nation by investing in the critical areas of human development; education, health, and lifting people out of poverty.”
On April 18, gunmen killed at least 12 people in the Tilengpat community of Pushit district, in Mangu LGA of Plateau.
Before this, gunmen killed at least 10 residents of Mandar Shar and Kopnanle villages under Mangu and Bokkos LGAs.

“I represent a different generation; a generation that accounts for over 70 percent of Nigeria’s voting population, so I definitely bring a different perspective and different way of thinking to the table. 
“Democracy is a game of numbers. You need to build consensus and the government needs to be able to convey its plans and ideas to the people in a way that they can relate to.
“I believe I bring that unique relatability to the current government. I bring vitality and vigour and a whole lot of ideas. Some we have to invent but most we just have to apply.”

‘Right thing will be done’ — EFCC replies group seeking Matawalle’s probe over ‘N70bn fraud’,https://www.thecable.ng/right-thing-will-be-done-efcc-tells-group-calling-for-probe-of-matawalles-n70bn-fraud-case/amp/,TheCable ,"The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) says it will conduct a thorough investigation into the allegation against Bello Matawalle, minister of state for defence.
In January, the commission said it would revisit the probe of Mattawalle over alleged N70 billion money laundering while he was the governor of Zamfara.
Addressing some protesters at the anti-graft headquarters in Abuja on Wednesday, Dele Oyewale, EFCC spokesperson, assured that the alleged fraud case against the former governor would be thoroughly investigated and brought to a convincing end.
“Investigations, as far as anti-corruption work is concerned, are not a press-button thing. Investigations have to be detailed; they have to be thorough, fully integrated, and broad-based. You have aired your views, and we will do what we’re supposed to do,” the EFCC spokesperson told the protesters.
“We’ll convey your message to the executive chairman. As you can see, the admin has been doing marvellously well, and it’ll do more.
“Every single thing that you have addressed in your letter will be conveyed to the appropriate quarters, and I can assure you that the right thing will be done.”
Speaking earlier, Aliyu Yunusa, chairman of Tinubu Youth and Women Network, a support group protesting Matawalle’s alleged fraud case, alleged that the minister mismanaged public funds and resources during his tenure as governor from 2019 to 2023.
Yunusa said the governor allegedly diverted government funds through proxies and contractors who received payments for contracts that were not executed.
“It is on record that on May 18, 2023, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), through its then Director of Media and Public Affairs, Osita Nwajah, stated that the EFCC is investigating Governor Matawalle over allegations of massive corruption, award of fictitious contracts, and diversion of over N70 billion,” he said.
“According to the EFCC, the money, which was sourced as a loan from an old-generation bank purportedly for the execution of projects across the local government areas of the state, was allegedly diverted by the governor through proxies and contractors who received payment for contracts that were not executed.
“The commission’s investigations revealed that over 100 companies had received payments from the funds, with no evidence of service rendered to the state. Some of the contractors who had been invited and quizzed by the commission made startling revelations on how the governor allegedly compelled them to return the funds received from the state coffers back to him through his aides after converting the same to United States dollars (hard currency).
“The companies confirmed that they did not render any service to Zamfara state.
“Still, they were allegedly directed to convert the monies paid to them into United States dollars (hard currency) and return them to the state governor through some of his commissioners, notably those in charge of Finance and Local Government Affairs.”
Last October, the Zamfara government revealed how Matawalle approved a 100 percent payment of over one billion Naira for fencing, landscaping, and furnishing of governor’s lodges in 14 LGAs before the project began.

"Steer clear of Rivers politics, PDP warns APC",https://www.thecable.ng/steer-clear-of-rivers-politics-pdp-warns-apc/amp/,TheCable ,"The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has warned the All Progressives Congress (APC) to steer clear of Rivers state politics.
In December 2023, 27 members of the Rivers house of assembly defected from the PDP to the APC.
On Friday, a state high court in Port Harcourt, the state capital, restrained the defected assembly members from parading themselves as legislators.
The court also granted an interim injunction restraining Martin Amaewhule from parading himself as a speaker of the house.
Before now, Siminalayi Fubara, governor of Rivers, said the existence of members of the assembly is based on his recognition.
But the APC condemned the governor’s statement, describing it as “reckless and a direct affront to the constitution”.
In a statement on Saturday, Debo Ologunagba, the national publicity secretary of the PDP, said the 27 lawmakers who defected to the APC should “admit their miscalculation and bear the inescapable consequences.”
He said the lawmakers’ seats would be vacant until a bye-election is conducted to fill them.
“The former members of the Rivers state house of assembly, for reasons best known to them, wittingly vacated and summarily lost their seats as nothing in the proviso protects or allows them to retain their membership of the Rivers state house of assembly after decamping from the political party upon which they were elected,” he said.
“These former members of the Rivers state house of assembly have only themselves to blame for constitutionally vacating their seats; a course which cannot be reversed or remedied. They should admit their miscalculation and bear the inescapable consequences.
“For the umpteenth time, the PDP cautions the APC to steer clear of Rivers state; it should perish the thoughts of forcefully taking over the state and stop exasperating the public space by seeking to reverse the irreversible.
“The APC should come to terms that with the vacation of seats by the former lawmakers, the quorum of the Rivers state house of assembly will be determined by the number of the remaining lawmakers as provided by law; until a bye-election is conducted to fill the vacancies now existing in the Rivers state house of assembly as a result of the defection by the former members.”

XeJet Airlines plane skids off Lagos airport runway,https://www.thecable.ng/just-in-xejet-airlines-plane-skids-off-lagos-airport-runway/amp/,TheCable ,"On Saturday, a XeJet Airlines plane veered off the runway at the Murtala Muhammed Airport Terminal Two (MMA2) in Lagos.
The Nigerian Safety Investigation Bureau (NSIB) confirmed the incident in a statement on Saturday.
The bureau said the aircraft, which departed Abuja, skidded off runway 18L on landing in Lagos — making a halt on “the grass verge.”
According to the agency, about 52 passengers were on board the ill-fated aircraft, with the call sign 5NBZZ.
“NSIB confirms that an aircraft belonging to Xejet airlines skidded off the runway at the domestic wing of Murtala Muhammed Airport this morning. A go team has been deployed to the site of the incident,” the statement reads.
“Fire and Rescue on ground to help in evacuation of the passengers.”
The bureau said the runway has been closed to traffic at the moment.
On September 1, 2023, the Nigeria Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) suspended the air operator certificate (AOC) and air transport licence (AOL) of XeJet over the “inability to authenticate ” the airline’s insurance documents.
The authority said the suspension followed the inability of the National Insurance Commission (NAICOM) to verify the authenticity of the aircraft insurance documents.

On Saturday, there were reports that the Lagos government deported some residents who are Osun indigenes.
In a post on X, Oluwaseyi Adeniyi, spokesperson of Ademola Adeleke, governor of Osun, confirmed that five luxurious buses were used to transport the people to Osun state.
Subsequently, Adeleke directed an immediate investigation into the alleged deportation.
The governor said Babajide Sanwo-Olu, governor of Lagos, expressed shock over the development and promised to take urgent action when he raised the matter with him.
Reacting to the development on Thursday, Falana said “317 Nigerian citizens of Osun state origin were rounded up in several parts of Lagos state and loaded into several luxury buses, which drove them to Osun state”.
He described the deportation as illegal, adding that since the Lagos government and police have denied involvement in the deportation, Sanwo-Olu should ensure that the deportees are brought back to the state.
“It is indisputable that the deportation of the so-called miscreants violated their fundamental right to freedom of movement, guaranteed by section 41 of the constitution,” Falana said.
“The illegal deportation also contravened article 12(5) of the African Charter on Human and Peoples Rights (Ratification and Enforcement) Act which has prohibited mass expulsion that targets national, racial, ethnic or religious groups.
“Since the deportation of the 317 citizens was not authorised by the Lagos state government, governor Sanwo-Olu should ensure that they are brought back to Lagos state as soon as possible.
“The Osun state governor, Mr Ademola Adeleke, who has protested on behalf of the deportees, should contribute to their resettlement in Lagos state.
“Furthermore, the officials of the Lagos state government who carried out the illegal deportation of the 317 citizens should be brought to book to prevent them from further expelling other poor people from Lagos state.”

Shittu served as minister of communications from 2015 to 2019 in Muhammadu Buhari’s first tenure as civilian president. 
In an interview on Sunrise Daily, a Channels Television programme, Shittu admitted that the Buhari administration failed to fulfil some of its campaign promises. 
“Even as an individual who had a mandate to oversee communications, there were several projects which I initiated but were frustrated along the line,” he said.
“For instance, I wanted to do an ICT university for Nigeria and I made a proposal and it got to the federal executive council, only for a number of our colleagues to oppose it and at the end of the day, Mr President said ‘Barrister Shittu, I want to commend you for your hard work on this memo but this is an overambitious project’.
“That was my saddest day in government.
“This is one of the things that happened and I was not happy but at the end of the day, when the federal executive council as a body rejects a proposal, you cannot do anything.”

“I did not regret serving because I was able to do other things,” he said. 
“We do know very well that Nigeria had virtually been run aground before he (Buhari) came onboard. Even as someone who served in the Buhari government during the first term, I am always honest enough to admit certain failures that we had.”

"80% of buildings in Lekki have no government approval, says commissioner",https://www.thecable.ng/80-of-buildings-in-lekki-have-no-government-approval-says-commissioner/amp/,TheCable ,"Oluyinka Olumide, commissioner for physical planning and urban development in Lagos, says 80 percent of buildings in the Ibeju Lekki-Epe corridor have no government approval.
The Lagos government has been facing backlash for the demolition of buildings and shanties across the state.
Tokunbo Wahab, commissioner for environment in Lagos, has repeatedly said the demolished structures were erected in contravention of the city’s masterplan, were never approved by the relevant agencies, and occluded drainage channels.
Punch reports Olumide as saying that despite the rigorous procedures involved in securing government approval, property developers and owners are still circumventing due process.
“Just last Thursday and Friday, my team and I were in the Ibeju Lekki and Epe axis and you would agree that anybody passing through that corridor would see a lot of estates marked,” he said. 
“We went there, and I can tell you that from what we saw, over 80 percent of them do not have approval. 
“The procedure to get approval is first to get the planning information, as to what those areas have been zoned for. In this case, what we have is agricultural land, and people now go to their families to buy agricultural land.
“Of course, those lands would be sold because those families do not know the use such land would be put to.
“The next thing to do is the fence permit. If you missed the earlier information on not knowing the area zoning, at the point of getting the fence permit, you would be able to detect what the area is zoned for. After that, the layout permits a large expanse of land.
“So, you can see all these layers. But people still go ahead to start advertising. Some have even gone to the extent of displaying the sizes they want to sell. Imagine someone in the diaspora who wants to send money without any knowledge. 
“Then, no approval is eventually gotten. Even if they pass the assignment and the survey to them, we would not grant the individual permit, because that area is not zoned for that purpose.”
On Sunday, Wahab said owners of recently demolished property in Maryland had been served notices since 2021.
“We are not just doing demolitions. The law allows us to remove encumbrances on the right of way of the drainage channels,” Wahab said on Channels Television.

"AT A GLANCE: 33 prosecuted, six convicted… EFCC’s corruption cases against ex-governors",https://www.thecable.ng/at-a-glance-33-prosecuted-six-convicted-efccs-corruption-cases-against-ex-governors/amp/,TheCable ,"Often, officials of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) knock at the doorsteps of former governors as soon as their immunity expires. They are asked to account for their financial decisions, especially when foul play is suspected. 
In 2023, Bello Matawalle, former governor of Zamfara and current minister of state for defence, criticised the EFCC for prosecuting only ex-governors, alleging that federal government officials are also corrupt.
However, the fight against corruption took a dramatic turn recently when Yahaya Bello, former governor of Kogi, “resisted” arrest by operatives of the EFCC and, at a point, was whisked away by Usman Ododo, his successor.
In this report, TheCable examines the trials of former governors by the EFCC since the anti-graft agency was established in 2003.

Some ex-governors were invited and grilled; others were investigated and arrested; yet, they have not been prosecuted. Those who fall under this category include Abdulaziz Yari and Bello Matawalle, former Zamfara governors; Kayode Fayemi, Ekiti; Samuel Ortom, Benue; Rabiu Kwankwaso, Kano; Theodore Orji, Abia; Aliyu Wamakko, Sokoto; Ali Modu Sheriff, Borno; the late Olusegun Agagu, Ondo and a few others.
But how many of the former governors have been charged so far, and how many have eventually been convicted?
PROSECUTED
Yahaya Bello, Kogi 
The EFCC is prosecuting Yahaya Bello alongside Ali Bello, Dauda Suleiman and Abdulsalam Hudu on 19-count charges bordering on money laundering to the tune of N80 billion. Bello served for two terms, from 2016 to 2024, as governor of Kogi.
On April 17, the EFCC operatives restricted movement in and around Bello’s house situated on Benghazi street, Wuse Zone 4, before Usman Ododo, his successor, arrived and was later seen leaving with Bello.
The EFCC also accused Bello of not showing up in court and served him charges through his counsel, Abdulwahab Muhammad.
Attahiru Bafarawa, Sokoto
The commission accused Bafarawa, who served as governor between 1999 and 2007, of misappropriating and embezzling N15 billion.
In 2018, a Sokoto state high court discharged and acquitted him of the corruption charges.
Meanwhile, in January 2024, a second witness in the trial said the former governor diverted a staggering N4.6 billion he received as a security fund from the office of Sambo Dasuki, the former national security adviser (NSA).
The anti-corruption agency is now prosecuting Bafarawa on amended 25-count charges bordering on criminal breach of trust and diversion of public funds
Abdulfatah Ahmed, Kwara
Abdulfatah Ahmed, a former governor of Kwara state, has been interrogated three times by the EFCC on how a sum of N3 billion was spent during his administration.
In December 2020, he was at the commission’s office in Ilorin to clarify certain transactions and decisions he took as governor. In May 2021, he was grilled at the EFCC headquarters in Abuja over allegations of fraud.
In February 2024, the former governor was arraigned on a 12-count charge bordering on alleged mismanagement of N10 billion in public funds.
Gabriel Suswam, Benue
Suswam and Omadachi Okolobia, a former commissioner of finance, are facing amended 11-count charges bordering on money laundering of N3.1 billion naira.
Murtala Nyako, Adamawa
On July 19, 2021, a federal high court in Abuja ruled that a former governor of Adamawa state, Murtala Nyako, has a case to answer in the N29 billion fraud charges brought against him by the EFCC.
Nyako is being prosecuted by the anti-graft agency alongside his son on 37-count charges of criminal conspiracy, stealing, abuse of office, and money laundering.
Timipre Sylva, Bayelsa
In 2015, the EFCC reopened a 42-count charge against Sylva for allegedly stealing the state fund between 2007 and 2011 when he was governor.
Sylva was charged alongside three others – Francis Okokuro, Gbenga Balogun, and Samuel Ogbuku – for allegedly using three companies—Marlin Maritime Limited, Eat Catering Services Limited, and Haloween-Blue Construction and Logistics Limited—to move about N19.2 billion from Bayelsa state coffers between 2009 and 2012, under a false pretence of using the withdrawn money to augment the salaries of state government workers.
Sule Lamido, Jigawa
The EFCC charged Lamido and two of his sons – Aminu and Mustapha — in 2015. They faced 37 amended charges bordering on money laundering until the case was thrown out.
In 2023, the court of appeal in Abuja dismissed the eight-year-long case on a technical ground of lack of jurisdiction by the federal high court to conduct the trial in Abuja instead of Jigawa.
Last year, the EFCC asked the supreme court to set aside the ruling of the appellate court.
Ayo Fayose, Ekiti
The EFCC is prosecuting Fayose for alleged N6.9 billion fraud and money laundering. The case started in 2014 when Fayose and one Abiodun Agbele were said to have taken possession of N1.2 billion to fund his gubernatorial election campaign in Ekiti.
His case recently stalled at the federal high court in Lagos after the judge failed to sit.
Chimaroke Nnamani, Enugu
Nnamani was prosecuted by the EFCC for a “N5.3 billion fraud”. The former governor was first arraigned before Justice Tijani Abubakar in 2007.
The Enugu ex-governor and Sunday Anyaogu, his aide, were linked to six firms that were reported to have laundered funds from the state treasury, especially funds meant for the LGAs state. The firms were Rainbownet Nigeria Limited, Hillgate Nigeria Limited, Cosmos FM, Capital City Automobile Nigeria Limited, Renaissance University Teaching Hospital and Mea Mater Elizabeth High School.
In 2015, a federal high court in Lagos convicted four companies belonging to Nnamani and ordered their forfeiture to the federal government.
The companies had pleaded guilty to a 10-count charge brought against them by the EFCC.
Sullivan Chime, Enugu
Following the end of his tenure in 2015, the former governor was investigated by the EFCC over his alleged role in the sharing of N23 billion campaign fund money involving Dieziani Alison-Madueke, former minister of petroleum.
He is one of the 13 governors the anti-corruption agency reopened their cases in January 2024.
Abdullahi Adamu, Nasarawa
Adamu served as governor of Nasarawa between 1999 and 2007. He was also the senator representing Nasarawa West until he became the national chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in 2022.
In March 2010, the EFCC filed a 149 count against Adamu and 18 others, including former Nasarawa state officials and contractors, over allegations involving N15 billion fraud.
Danjuma Goje, Gombe
Following an eight-year-long back and forth, the EFCC, in 2019, handed over Goje’s “N25 billion fraud” case to the office of the attorney-general of the federation.
The federal government later withdrew the corruption charges against him.
Peter Odili, Rivers
A few months ago, the EFCC reopened the investigation of Peter Odili over the alleged diversion of N100 billion while he was governor of Rivers between 1999 and 2007.
However, since 2008, Odili has had a perpetual court injunction preventing the EFCC from investigating or arresting him.
Abubakar Audu, Kogi
In 2013, the EFCC arraigned the former governor of Kogi State, Abubakar Audu, alongside Ibn Mustapha, a former director general of the directorate of rural development in his administration, before Justice A.O. Adeniyi of the high court sitting in Abuja.
The duo were arraigned on a 36-count charge bordering on criminal breach of trust and misappropriation of public funds to the tune of N10 billion.
Audu died in 2015.
Gbenga Daniel, Ogun
Gbenga Daniel was arrested on October 6, 2011, a few months after the end of his tenure.
Subsequently, in what later turned out to be an 11-year-long trial, the former governor faced a 38-count charge of stealing public funds, bribery, fraudulent conversion of public property and false declaration of assets to the tune of N211.3 million.
In 2022, a three-man panel of the appeal court sitting in Ibadan, Oyo state, dismissed the corruption charges against Daniel and held that the former governor was being prosecuted for non-existent offences and for offences for which there was no evidence to substantiate.
Saminu Turaki, Jigawa
The EFCC had, in July 2007, filed a 32-count charge of corruption and money laundering against Turaki at a federal high court in Dutse, the state capital. The anti-graft agency accused him of laundering N36 billion from the state coffers.
Although his trial was stalled along the line when the EFCC claimed he had absconded after being granted bail, he was later re-arrested in Abuja by operatives of the commission and brought before a court for trial on September 19.
In 2022, he was acquitted by the court, but the EFCC said it would return to court over the case.
Rochas Okorocha, Imo
On May 30, 2022, the EFCC arraigned the former governor of Imo, who is now a Nigerian senator, and six others on 17-count charges bordering on conspiracy, stealing, conversion of public funds, and money laundering to the tune of N3 billion.
A federal capital territory high court in Abuja dismissed the suit in July 2023 as “an abuse of court process”.
Ikedi Ohakim, Imo
Ohakim was prosecuted by the EFCC for allegedly making a cash payment of over $2 million for a piece of land at Asokoro, Abuja.
The EFCC said the investigation into the alleged offence began in 2010 – a year before the expiration of Ohakim’s tenure – after the commission received petitions coupled with intelligence reports.
Jonah Jang, Plateau
Jang and Yusuf Pam, a former cashier in the office of the secretary to the state government (OSSG) faced trial for alleged criminal breach of trust and misappropriation of Plateau funds to the tune of N6.3 billion.
In 2018, the anti-corruption agency said it traced properties worth N500 million to the former governor. The commission said he purchased the properties from New Capital Properties Limited, a subsidiary of Northern Nigerian Development Company (NNDC), Kaduna.
In 2022, the court acquitted Jang of the corruption charges levelled against him.
Usman Dakingari, Kebbi
The former governor oversaw the administration of Kebbi from 2012 to 2015 before the election that brought him in was annulled.
In 2018, he was arraigned on a 13-count charge of conspiracy and money laundering to the tune of N450 million.
The former governor allegedly connived with two other defendants to collect the sum that was said to have been distributed by Deizani Allison Madueke, former minister of petroleum resources, to influence the 2015 general election.
Ramalan Yero, Kaduna
In 2018, a federal high court sitting in Kaduna remanded Ramalan Yero over “his role” in the disbursement of N750 million in campaign funds for the PDP during the 2015 general election.
He was remanded alongside Nuhu Wya, a former minister; Abubakar Gaya-Haruna, a former chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Kaduna; and Hamza Ishaq, a former secretary to the Kaduna state government.
In 2022, he was re-arraigned, but he pleaded “not guilty” to the charges against him.
Ibrahim Shema, Katsina
The EFCC arraigned Shema in 2017 on a 22-count charge of criminal breach of trust, forgery and abuse of office.
Before his arraignment, the former governor had refused to honour the commission’s invitation.
Shema was charged alongside Sani Makana, commissioner for local government and chieftaincy affairs; Lawal Safana, permanent secretary for local government and chieftaincy affairs; and Ibrahim Lawal Dankaba, chairman, Katsina Association of Local Government of Nigeria (ALGON), for allegedly diverting public funds to the tune of N11 billion during his tenure as governor between 2012 and May 2015.
The state later withdrew the case.
Rashidi Ladoja, Oyo
In 2008, the EFCC dragged Ladoja and Waheed Akanbi, who served as commissioner for finance under the former governor, to court over a N4.7 billion fraud case.
After an 11-year-old trial, Mohammed Idris, the presiding judge, discharged and acquitted the former governor, saying the evidence brought to court against the defendants was “too low on credible evidence.”
Alao Akala, Oyo
Before his death, the EFCC arraigned the former governor on an 11-count charge bordering on alleged criminal conspiracy and fraudulent practices to the tune of N11.5 billion.
Akala stood trial alongside Hosea Agboola, former commissioner for local government and chieftaincy affairs, and Olufemi Babalola, chief executive officer of Pentagon Consults.
Akwe Doma, Nasarawa
Doma served as Nasarawa governor for a term. Shortly after his tenure, the commission started the prosecution of the former governor on a 10-count charge bordering on financial crimes.
Between 2007 and 2009, Doma allegedly conspired with some government officials to fraudulently launder state funds to the tune of N8 billion.
He died in 2018 at the age of 75.
James Ngilari, Adamawa
Ngilari served briefly between 2007 and 2008 as governor of Adamawa.
Despite his stint, the former governor was charged and remanded in EFCC’s custody for violation of procurement laws in the award of a contract of N167 million for the supply of twenty-five units of operational vehicles (Toyota Corolla).
In March 2017, Ngilari was sentenced to five years in jail without an option of a fine by a Yola high court, but he was later acquitted and freed by the court of appeals in July of the same year.
Willie Obiano, Anambra
Earlier this year, the commission arraigned Willie Obiano, a former governor of Anambra state, before a federal high court in Abuja on nine counts charges bordering on money laundering, diversion of funds, stealing, and corruption to the tune of N4 billion.
The presiding judge ordered that the defendant’s passport and travel documents be kept in the custody of the court and that the Nigeria Immigration Service be notified of the arrangements.
CONVICTED
Joshua Dariye, Plateau
After a trial that lasted eight years, in June 2018, Dariye was finally sentenced to 14 years in prison for criminal breach of trust and two years for misappropriation of public funds, to run concurrently.
He was released from the correctional facility in the Kuje council area of the federal capital territory (FCT), on August 8, 2022, after receiving a presidential pardon from former President Muhammadu Buhari.
Jolly Nyame, Taraba
The EFCC charged Nyame with abuse of office and diversion of N1.64 billion during his tenure as governor of Taraba between 1999 and 2007.
Having stood trial for about 11 years, Adebukola Banjoko, judge of a federal capital territory high court in Gudu, convicted Nyame on May 30, 2018, and sentenced him to 14 years in prison.
The former governor then appealed the judgment and the jail term was reduced to 12 years. Still dissatisfied, he headed to the apex court. In 2020, the supreme court affirmed the judgment of the court of appeal.
Two years later, in April 2022, at a council of state meeting, former President Muhammadu Buhari pardoned Nyame.
Lucky Igbinedion, Edo
Following his tenure as governor of Edo from 1999 to 2007, Igbinedion was convicted in December 2008 for embezzling N2.9 billion which belonged to the state.
In 2008, a federal high court in Enugu sentenced him to six months imprisonment with the option of a N3.5 million fine. The judge also ordered the forfeiture of N500 million, and three properties, including one in Abuja, seized from him.
In 2021, he was detained by the EFCC over alleged criminal diversion of public funds to the tune of N1.6 billion.
James Ibori, Delta
After his term as Delta governor, in 2012, Ibori was sentenced by a United Kingdom Southwark Crown Court to 13 years in prison after he was found guilty of counts of money laundering and related offences to the tune of £50 million.
He was released in December 2016, having spent about half of the jail sentence in a UK prison.
Nuhu Ribadu, then EFCC chairman, alleged that Ibori attempted to bribe him to drop the charges with a cash gift of $15 million, which Ribadu immediately lodged in the Central Bank of Nigeria as an exhibit.
Diepreye Alamieyeseigha, Bayelsa
Alamieyeseigha was impeached as governor in 2005 and in December of that year, he was arrested by the EFCC and charged with money laundering and corruption offences.
Before this, he had been arrested by the London Metropolitan Police and was charged with three counts of money laundering. 
In July 2007, Alamieyesigha pleaded guilty and was sentenced to two years in prison from the day of his arrest two years earlier. He was released a few hours after his sentence. On March 12, 2013, President Goodluck Jonathan granted Alamieyeseigha a state pardon.
Orji Kalu, Abia
In 2019, Kalu, a member of the senate, was sentenced to 12 years imprisonment after he was convicted of diverting N7.1 billion from the coffers of Abia state during his time as governor.
The EFCC had opened a 36-count charge against him and Ude Jones Udeogu, a former director of finance and accounts in Abia. On May 8, 2020, the supreme court nullified his conviction, and Kalu was released from prison.
Recently, the EFCC said it would fix the loopholes in its tactics to reopen the N6.7bn fraud case against the former governor.

EFCC chairman: How 17-year-old boy mesmerised me with his internet fraud skills,https://www.thecable.ng/efcc-chairman-how-17-year-old-boy-mesmerised-me-with-his-internet-fraud-skills/amp/,TheCable ,"Ola Olukoyede, chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), has recounted how a 17-year-old boy mesmerised him with his internet fraud skills.
Speaking at a press conference in Abuja, the EFCC chairman said the boy was able to decipher his banking details, including the bank verification number (BVN), by just knowing his mobile phone number.
“I brought in a 17-year-old who is studying History and Anthropology. He is not doing anything science. He sat there in my office in Lagos and demonstrated something to me on my laptop,” Olukoyede said.
“He asked for my (phone number) number and through it, he got my BVN. He mentioned the name of my account without me telling him anything.”
The EFCC chairman said the commission is not interested in sending internet fraudsters to jail but in rehabilitating them for better purposes.
“On our own, we plead for a light sentence for them, so we can reorientate them,” he said.
“What joy will I derive from sending a 17-year-old to jail? You would have destroyed his future, you would have destroyed his career. Most times they are given the option of a fine.
“We bring them back, lecture them and talk to them. This particular boy, when I asked him why he does what he does. He said both of his parents are farmers and could not go to the farm because of insecurity.
“He is the one feeding his parent. He is the one responsible for the tuition of his younger ones.
“In as much as I want to do my job, I saw a Bill Gates in the guy. I told him If he gets out of this, I will personally take responsibility for his schooling.”
Olukoyede said the anti-graft agency is setting up a cybercrime research centre where internet fraudsters will be reoriented.
“Now we are coming up with what we call a cybercrime research centre as a part of the projects in our new academy where we would bring some of these boys during vacation, the way they are capturing them, the way we have 419 training schools,” he said.
“We are going to come up with a hub that would help us channel those skills towards positive things.”
In March, Olukoyede said the agency has plans to rehabilitate convicted internet fraudsters with lesser sentences.
He told the delegation of the National Association of University Students (NAUS) that the rehabilitation would be a potent way of reorienting the minds of the convicts and redirecting their productive energies to positive endeavours.

16 passengers burnt to death in Enugu auto crash,https://www.thecable.ng/16-passengers-burnt-to-death-in-enugu-auto-crash/amp/,TheCable ,"The police command in Enugu says 16 persons were killed in a road accident after an 18-seater bus lost control and rammed into a section of Maduka University.
Daniel Ndukwe, Enugu police spokesperson, said the incident occurred around 5:30pm on Tuesday, adding that the Toyota bus went up in flames, burning the passengers beyond recognition.
He added that two persons survived the incident and were immediately hospitalised.
The spokesperson said the take-off point and final destination of the victims were yet to be ascertained.
“An 18-seater white-coloured Toyota Hummer bus with registration number: DAS 215 XA, and with an inscription, ‘Marsha Alla’ driving at a high speed towards Nsukka from the Enugu axis of the road, suddenly lost control and plunged into a fence belonging to Maduka University along the road,” the spokesperson said.
“It immediately burst into flames after hitting the fence and burnt beyond recognition, 16 passengers on board.
“Only two passengers were rescued alive by police officers, soldiers, and good-spirited individuals, and taken to a hospital for immediate medical attention.
“The vehicle was loaded with edible vegetables, food items, and luggage belonging to the deceased passengers.”
On April 28, 19 persons were burnt to death in an auto crash along the Okene-Lokoja highway in Kogi state.

"Lagos-Calabar highway: Umahi directs closure of Landmark beach, begins demolition of shanties",https://www.thecable.ng/lagos-calabar-highway-fg-directs-closure-of-landmark-beach-begins-demolition-of-shanties-on-right-of-way/amp/,TheCable ,"David Umahi, minister of works, has flagged off the demolition of structures on the government’s right of way for the construction of the Lagos-Calabar coastal highway.
In an interaction with journalists on Saturday, the minister said no structure belonging to the Landmark beach resort was demolished, adding that only shanties erected on the government’s right of way were affected.
“Landmark has unfortunately made so much noise about this. I have revisited the place, and I can say none of his infrastructure is affected. Just the shanties are affected and they are bulldozed already. We are passing our coastal bridge within the right of way of the federal government,” he said.
“I have directed that the beach should be shut down for tomorrow and there is no beach. The place is owned by people who are sand filling it, and at the end of the day, there is no more beach.
“Those who are playing politics with it can go ahead. My job is simple: to pass the coastal road. It’s in a right-of-way within the coastal corridor which is the legitimate right-of-way of the federal government.”
The minister said those affected by the demolition will be adequately compensated, adding that documentation will start on May 2-3. 
Bolaji Ariyo, chief executive officer of Mami Chula Beach, said he shared the project’s vision “even if it causes inconvenience for a small number of people”.
“I understand when a government is promising to make life easy for the entire Nigerians. Some of us are affected, no doubt about it, but those affected are not up to 0.1% of the millions that will enjoy the coastal road,” Ariyo said.
“That’s why people like me have taken it to heart to also support Mr President and the honourable minister to ensure that this road comes to life.”
Employees of Landmark recently staged a protest against the sand filling of the beach for the road construction."
IED ‘planted by ISWAP’ kills eight members of civilian JTF in Borno,https://www.thecable.ng/ied-planted-by-iswap-kills-eight-members-of-civilian-cjf-in-borno/amp/,TheCable ,"At least, eight members of the civilian joint task force (CJTF) have been killed by an improvised explosive device (IED) planted by terrorists associated with the Islamic State’s West Africa Province (ISWAP) in Gamborun LGA of Borno.
Three other victims reportedly sustained various degrees of injuries from the incident.
Zagazola Makama, a counter-insurgency publication focused on the Lake Chad region, reports that eight of the victims died instantly after they stepped on a landmine suspected to have been planted by ISWAP on Saturday.
The victims were reportedly on their way to Maiduguri from Gamborun Ngala.
The publication said the wounded victims were evacuated to the hospital, while the CJTF members who died were taken to their families for burial arrangements.
On April 21, troops of the Nigerian Army (NA) destroyed a bread factory at an ISWAP hideout in Borno.
In January, three ISWAP commanders and 22 other members of the terrorist group were reportedly killed in military air strikes in the state.
On April 17, about 10 passengers in a commercial vehicle were killed and 20 sustained injuries after the vehicle stepped on an improvised explosive device (IED) planted at a roadside in Borno state.

TUC: New minimum wage announcement on Workers’ Day unrealistic,https://www.thecable.ng/tuc-expectation-of-new-minimum-wage-announcement-on-workers-day-unrealistic/amp/,TheCable ,"Festus Osifo, president of the Trade Union Congress (TUC), says organised labour’s expectation that the federal government will announce a new minimum wage on May 1 is unrealistic.
In January, the government set up a 37-member tripartite committee on the minimum wage. 
Subsequently, organised labour submitted a demand of N615,000 as the new minimum wage for workers, and urged the government to announce the new minimum wage on Workers’ Day. 
Speaking with NAN on Friday, Osifo said negotiations with the federal government on a new minimum wage are ongoing. 
“The negotiation by the tripartite committee is still ongoing. If you remember, the TUC earlier submitted N447,000 as the new minimum wage but we have harmonised our figure with the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC),” he said.
“It is now N615,000. Regarding the ‘when’ for the new minimum wage, the committee is still working.
“So, certainly, May 1, will not work for the pronouncement of the new minimum wage. Except if the federal government wants to pay the minimum wage of N500,000 to workers.
“If you look at the N615, 000, you will think that the amount is right but when we did that computation, a dollar was about N1, 700.
“I am hopeful that the committee will meet after May 1.”

"CSOs fault award of oil pipeline protection contracts to ‘militants, ex-bandits’",https://www.thecable.ng/csos-fault-award-of-pipeline-protection-contracts-to-militants-ex-bandits/amp/,TheCable ,"The Civil Society Coalition for Mandate Protection (CSC-MAP) has asked the federal government to stop awarding oil pipeline protection contracts in the Niger Delta region to “militants”.
At a rally in the Ojota area of Lagos on Wednesday, the coalition of 55 civil society groups said such contracts should be awarded to professionals and not “former bandits who once led an armed insurrection against the state”.
In a statement signed by Micheal Ajayi, deputy coordinator of the coalition, the groups said “indigenous peoples from the oil-producing communities feel sidelined by this arrangement and are opposed to the idea of giving pipeline protection contracts to armed groups”.
“The NNPC may be unconsciously empowering armed groups through pipeline contracts in the Niger Delta,” the statement adds. 
“The majority of people in oil-producing companies are sidelined by the fact that some of the companies involved in the pipeline protection are not indigenous to the communities and territories expected to be protected.
“The indigenous communities like Itsekiri and Ilaje are being sidelined. There is a looming dispute which can snowball into a major problem.
“It is inconceivable that oil pipeline protection in Itsekiri and Ilaje have been handed over to interests that fought these communities with arms and ammunition in the past.”
The groups advised the government to launch a new amnesty programme to ensure that armed groups remaining in the Niger Delta surrender their weapons. 
Earlier this month, the Civil Society Coalition in Nigeria (CSCN) called on the government to ensure pipeline protection contracts are no longer awarded to militants.
The group said it amounted to “self-deceit” for militants to be given billions of naira to protect oil pipelines, noting that such an act may further fuel the proliferation of illicit arms in the Niger Delta region.
Corroborating this in March, Tajudeen Olanrewaju, a former minister of communications, said “repentant” non-state actors cannot be trusted with the security of Nigeria’s oil pipelines.

Obi: Lagos-Calabar coastal highway a misplaced priority… may not be completed in 30 years,https://www.thecable.ng/obi-lagos-calabar-coastal-highway-a-misplaced-priority-may-not-be-completed-in-30-years/amp/,TheCable ,"Peter Obi, presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP) in the 2023 elections, says the construction of the Lagos-Calabar coastal highway is a misplaced priority by the federal government.
In a series of posts on his X handle on Monday, the former Anambra governor said the government should focus on completing the countless abandoned road projects across the country.
“At the forefront of my concerns is the pressing issue of numerous uncompleted roads scattered across the country many of which have become hazardous death traps and security risks,” Obi wrote.
“Most of these roads, vital for economic growth, regional connectivity, and overall development have been under construction for several years if not decades now and are unlikely to be completed any time soon due to poor and unplanned funding.”
Obi said despite the envisaged benefits of the coastal highway, its funding would “only exacerbate the problem of abandoned uncompleted projects that are not contributing to economic growth and overall development” of the country.
He said the project may not be completed in the next 30 years and advised the federal government to prioritise the urgent needs of Nigerians.
“We must allocate resources towards repairing and completing existing infrastructure crucial for the well-being and safety of our society, before embarking on new projects, no matter their perceived benefits,” he said.
“Let’s prioritise the urgent needs of our people and ensure that our investments serve the collective good of the nation.
“In any development formula, the primary focus should be on completing and rehabilitating existing infrastructure rather than embarking on colossal new projects that may never reach completion within the next 30 years.”
Meanwhile, a week ago during an interview on Channels Television, Dave Umahi, minister of works, said the project would be completed in eight years.

"Kwankwaso destroying NNPP, attempting to hijack party structure, says founder",https://www.thecable.ng/kwankwaso-destroying-nnpp-attempting-to-hijack-party-structure-says-founder/amp/,TheCable ,"Boniface Aniebonam, the founder of the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP), says Rabiu Kwankwaso, former governor of Kano, is destroying the party.
In 2023, NNPP’s board of trustees (BoT) suspended Kwankwaso, who was its presidential candidate in the last elections, over allegations of anti-party activities.
However, another faction of the party loyal to the former governor of Kano reversed the suspension.
Kwankwaso was subsequently expelled from the party after he failed to appear before the disciplinary committee set up to probe allegations of anti-party activities against him.
Speaking at a news conference in Lagos on Friday, Aniebonam, a former chairman of the BoT, said Kwankwaso is making attempts to hijack the party’s structure.
“Buba Galadima led the delegation, including Senator Suleiman Hunkuyi and Professor Sam Angai to my country home in Anambra, to plead for us to accept Kwankwaso in the NNPP,” he said.
“After the talks, I placed a call to Kwankwaso and after asking him questions about his intentions for Nigeria, I offered him the platform of NNPP as its sole candidate.
“I believed that Kwankwaso was not aware of the internal crisis in the party until he came out openly on live television, displaying a new logo and flag for the NNPP and mutilating its constitution.
“It is disturbing and if I continue to keep quiet, it will not be in the interest of the soul of the party as the founder and at some point, its board chairman.
“The party’s constitution says the founder is a life member of the board and even when I’m alive, my brother and good friend, Kwankwaso, for whatever reasons, is destroying the party I built from 2002 to 2022 when he joined us to contest the 2023 presidency.
“I funded the party for 22 years and Kwankwaso wants to hijack it even when he is not a member of the board of trustees or the leader of the party.
“The kangaroo convention even when there was a court order stopping it, is null and void because a Federal High Court in Abuja on Thursday ruled that the NNPP issue is an internal crisis.
“This means that the issues can only be settled using the constitution. However, we are ready to pursue the interpretation of the constitution up to the Supreme Court.”
Aniebonam maintained that Kwankwaso and others were expelled from the party for anti-party activities.
The NNPP founder added that he would grant him a pardon if he purged himself of what he was doing.

Landmark CEO: FG yet to consult us on Lagos-Calabar highway project,https://www.thecable.ng/landmark-ceo-fg-yet-to-officially-consult-us-on-lagos-calabar-highway-project/amp/,TheCable ,"Paul Onwuanibe, chief  executive officer (CEO) of Landmark Africa Group, says government has not formally contacted the resort on the impact the construction of the Lagos-Calabar highway would have on its business. 
On Wednesday, some employees of the resort staged a protest to show their disapproval, after the federal government began sand filling of the beachfront for the construction of the coastal highway. 
The 700-kilometre Lagos-Calabar coastal highway is expected to run through the shoreline of the beach resort in Lagos, while traversing eight other states. 
Addressing the development on Thursday in a statement issued by Elsie Ogianyo, brand and corporate communications manager of Landmark, Onwuanibe said “till date, Landmark has never been officially consulted on the coastal highway alignment nor have we been engaged in discussions with regards to the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) of the project on Landmark”. 
“The accelerated sand filling on the Landmark shoreline has sent widespread panic and fear to the independent businesses, suppliers, employees, investors, financiers, and clients that all conduct business within the Landmark Ecosystem,” the statement reads. 
The CEO also said a rerouting of the project should have been considered by government.
“Along the original 1.5km coastal road route which passes through the Water Corporation Road median, there are no permanent structures whatsoever. This original alignment remains unused, undeveloped and available till date for the development of the coastal highway,” the statement reads.
“We feel that rerouting back to this original alignment is one of the several, credible win-win solutions that exist that will also avoid disruption to the beach.
“Of the 80+ businesses that make up the Landmark Ecosystem, over half of them are situated on the Landmark Beach directly in the right of way of the coastal road.
“These businesses have invested between NGN15-20 billion on their businesses in addition to the NGN25 billion that Landmark has invested in the underlying infrastructure.”
The statement said over 12,000 Nigerians are directly and indirectly employed by Landmark, and that their “livelihoods would be greatly jeopardised if the beach is demolished”.
“As we continue to pursue dialogue with officials at all levels of the government, we are sure to receive a formal notification with regard to a timeline for the potential resolution of this matter to quell the fears and uncertainty felt throughout our community,” the statement adds. 
On April 11, Dave Umahi, minister of works, said the road construction will not affect Landmark’s facilities, adding that the project’s corridor has been reduced to 50 meters.
Umahi said only the shoreline could be lost.

Adeleke announces Osun logo design competition after criticism of ‘specimen’,https://www.thecable.ng/adeleke-announces-osun-logo-design-competition-after-criticism-of-specimen/amp/,TheCable ,"Ademola Adeleke, governor of Osun, has announced a state logo design competition following the criticism of the quality of the initial design.
On Wednesday, the governor assented to a bill adopting a new logo for the state.
Subsequently, the logo was released with Olawale Rasheed, the governor’s spokesperson, describing it as “a signal of rebirth” for the state.
But some Nigerians, including indigenes of the state, faulted the quality of the logo claiming it was poorly designed and unfit to serve as the state’s symbol.
In response, the state government said the logo is a specimen and a three-dimensional version of it will be unveiled during ‘Ipade Imole’, a stakeholders meeting, on April 30.
In another statement on Thursday, Rasheed said the governor has announced the organisation of a logo design competition to be held between April 19 and 26.
He said participants are required to “take into account the prototype logo in terms of its contents and style.”
The content of the initial logo included peculiar symbols like the Oranmiyan bust, the Erin-Ijesha waterfall, fish and cocoa pods.
The governor’s spokesperson said the winner will be announced on April 28, while the best three designers will be invited and compensated.
“The submission can be made in person both soft and printed copy to the Office of the Commissioner, Ministry of Information and Public Enlightenment,” the statement reads.
“Entries can also be submitted online via emailus@osunstate.gov.ng or statelogo@osunstate.gov, with bio data and contact details of the designer. The subject should be with the subject “OSUN STATE LOGO”.
“The best design will be announced on April 28 and will be unveiled on April 30th during the new edition of Ipade Imole.”

Ganduje’s son visits Kano anti-graft agency amid ‘corruption’ charges against his dad,https://www.thecable.ng/gandujes-son-visits-kano-anti-graft-agency-amid-corruption-charges-against-his-dad/amp/,TheCable ,"Abdulazeez Ganduje, son of Abdullahi Ganduje, national chair of the All Progressives Congress (APC), on Wednesday visited the Kano state anti-corruption and public complaints commission.
On Tuesday, Muhuyi Magaji, chair of the anti-graft agency, said the commission is investigating a fresh case where N51 billion was allegedly diverted by the Ganduje administration.
The commission had earlier filed criminal charges against the former governor over an alleged $413,000 and N1.38 billion bribe.
The commission said it had assembled 15 witnesses to testify against Ganduje.
Abdulazeez, who is the first son of Ganduje, reportedly visited the anti-graft agency to show support for the commission’s case against his dad, mum and brother. 
In 2021, Abdulazeez dragged Hafsat Ganduje, his mother, to the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) over a bribery and land fraud case.
Ganduje was suspended from the APC by his ward over corruption allegations, with a Kano court upholding the suspension on Wednesday."
Landmark employees protest as FG begins sand filling for Lagos-Calabar highway,https://www.thecable.ng/landmark-employees-protest-as-fg-begins-sand-filling-for-lagos-calabar-highway/amp/,TheCable ,"Some employees of the Landmark Beach Resort in the Oniru area of Lagos commenced a protest on Wednesday as the federal government begins the sand filling of the beachfront for the construction of the coastal highway. 
Scores of employees at the beach resort carried placards with inscriptions ‘#SaveLandmarkBeachResort’ and ‘Save Our Jobs’, and chanted songs of dissent in unison. 
The 700-kilometre Lagos-Calabar coastal highway is expected to run through nine states and would have a railroad running through the middle.
Earlier this month, Dave Umahi, minister of works, said the project will not affect the Landmark facilities, adding that the project’s corridor has been reduced to 50 meters and only the shoreline could be lost.
“What could be lost is the shoreline and people that go to play at the shoreline, but his (Landmark CEO) facilities are all intact because we reduced the corridor to 50 meters. I saw it, there is no permanent structure, other than a few shanties along that shoreline that would be affected,” Umahi said in an interview on Arise Television.
“So I told him no single job will be lost because all his distance is very much intact. There is no single one of them that is to be demolished.”
In an interview with Arise Television on April 7, Paul Onwuanibe, the chief executive officer of Landmark Africa, said the original plan for the coastal highway did not include the beachfront.
The businessman who obtained the land in 2007 said “the alignment was changed so that instead of it running on the land side of Landmark, it is going to run on the beach side”.
“So that is where this issue came up is that the alignment was changed. Our request is simply to go back to the original alignment, nothing is wrong with it,” he added. 
“Now they are looking to put the road on the beachfront and just immediately after Landmark it turns and goes back to its original alignment.
“Going back to the original alignment saves our business and saves the government a lot of money.”
In a series of posts on X, Onwuanibe described the highway as a “laudable project that should enhance tourism rather than destroy it”, adding that the management of Landmark is in “active talks” with the state and federal governments.
He said the government has assured him that there would be no disruption to his business and “a small number of other minor reroutes may be required to sustain the existing socioeconomic activity along the course of this road”.
Meanwhile, Atiku Abubakar, former vice-president, had accused President Bola Tinubu of placing his personal business interest ahead of Nigerians with the coastal highway project.
The former presidential candidate added that the project will lead to a loss of over 12,000 direct and indirect jobs and over $200 million in investments.

Fatai Owoseni: Gunmen who invaded Oyo secretariat seemed to be on cheap drugs,https://www.thecable.ng/fatai-owoseni-gunmen-who-invaded-oyo-secretariat-seemed-to-be-on-cheap-drugs/amp/,TheCable ,"Fatai Owoseni, special adviser on security matters to Seyi Makinde, governor of Oyo, says separatists who invaded the state secretariat were miscreants who probably acted under the influence of substances. 
On Saturday, security officers arrested 16 gunmen suspected to be members of a group identified as Oodua nation, for invading the state secretariat at Agodi, Ibadan.
The gunmen, who were arrayed in local charms and military camouflage, were subdued by security personnel after a gun duel.
The agitators were said to have removed the Nigerian national flag in the secretariat and hoisted an ‘Oodua nation flag’, before the intervention of security officials.
In an interview on Morning Brief, a Channels Television programme, on Monday, Owoseni, a former commissioner of police in Lagos, described the arrested agitators as “miscreants that seem to be on some kind of cheap drugs”.
He said some of the agitators’ hideouts have been uncovered, adding that the government will tame all those involved in the self-determination movement.
“The attackers are miscreants that seem to be on some kind of cheap drugs. Just like some movements where they are indoctrinated and think they can play some stunt and gain recognition,” he said.
“When you have such a movement of people who have been brainwashed, these are people who would have been promised heaven.
“From little interrogation, some of them said there is a proclamation that the Yoruba nation has gained independence. 
“We must own up to it that in the country, there is proliferation of different armed groups. Some are under the guise of private security guards. So, it is a cumulation of what has been happening in the country that has not been checked.
“So many other things have happened after this, areas which were discovered to be their cells where they are doing things have been burst. More recoveries and arrests have been made. More revelations have come out. 
“The state has the capacity to get around this and we are not relenting. We will continue to do what we do covertly to ensure these people are tamed and that they don’t use this place as a launchpad.”

‘Those with integrity are with us’ – Fubara hails Odili for declaring him Rivers political leader,https://www.thecable.ng/those-with-integrity-are-with-us-fubara-hails-odili-for-declaring-him-rivers-political-leader/amp/,TheCable ,"Siminalayi Fubara, governor of Rivers, has described Peter Odili, ex-governor of the state, as someone with integrity.
On April 11, Odili publicly announced his support for Fubara and declared the governor as the political leader of the state.
“Our people said I should tell you to stand with the president and align with his positive policies and link the people of Rivers state with the centre,” Odili said.
“They have asked me to tell you that you are the political leader of Rivers state. Rivers people say where you go, they will go with you.”
In his speech at the inauguration of a healthcare facility in Ogba/Egbema/Ndoni LGA, Odili’s hometown, Fubara said he is happy to have the support of the former governor.
Fubara said Odili’s backing has triggered “people high blood pressure”, adding that his detractors are now “restless, granting all sorts of media interviews.”
“I’ve said it before, and I’m saying it again. It doesn’t matter the number of people that stand with you. Even if you’re standing alone, no matter the side you’re standing on, provided you are standing on the right side, maintain your stand. We are happy to stand with him (Odili),” Fubara said.
“We are also happy that he is standing with us. Even his person alone is giving people high blood pressure. They are restless, granting all sorts of media interviews. Why are they doing it? It is because the people that matter, the people that have what they claimed they have; integrity, are with us. That is the truth.
“So, if we have one person who has integrity and character, is it not better than having 1,000 persons with questionable character? So, we are happy to identify with him.”
Since taking office in May 2023, Fubara has been locked in a struggle for control of Rivers political structure with Nyesom Wike, his successor and minister of the federal capital territory (FCT).
Earlier this month, Wike criticised some leaders of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Rivers for lacking integrity and declaring support for Fubara.
He described them as “expired politicians” who are not worthy of being called “elder statesmen”.

On April 14, 2014, about 276 girls were abducted by terrorists from their school dormitory in Chibok, Borno state.
Following a raft of releases through the years, the military said 76 Chibok schoolgirls had so far escaped, while 107 were released by Boko Haram in 2018.
The military added that about 108 of the girls are still missing.
In a statement on Sunday, Ozumba Nicodemus, CAN’s national director for education, youth and women development, said the pain and anguish of losing one’s children remain in the psyche of the parents of the abducted girls.
“The trauma experienced by the remaining abducted girls from Nigeria is unimaginable. The pain and anguish felt by their parents, who have endured sleepless nights filled with hopelessness, are deeply felt by CAN,” the statement reads. 
“We cannot remain silent while their children remain in captivity, yearning for freedom and reunion with their families.
“It is our duty as a nation to ensure their safe return and to bring an end to the anguish and suffering endured by these innocent young girls and their families.
“We call on the government to mobilise all available resources, engage relevant security agencies, and collaborate with international partners to secure the release of the remaining Chibok girls.
“Together, we can amplify our voices and exert greater pressure on the abductors to bring an end to this prolonged ordeal.”
CAN said it will continue to engage with relevant stakeholders on the issue.
“We will continue to engage with relevant stakeholders and utilise all available avenues to shed light on their plight and secure their release,” the statement adds. 
“We urge all Nigerians to stand united, to lend their voices and to demand immediate action from the government.
“Let us show our unwavering support for the families of the Chibok girls and demonstrate our collective determination to bring them back home.”

Abimbola Ajibola, the Otun Balogun, had alleged that Olakulehin was unfit for the kingship, raising concerns over the health of the 84-year-old ex-military officer.
During a meeting at the Oja-Oba palace of the Olubadan on Friday, the Olubadan-in-council confirmed Olakulehin suitable to be enthroned as the 43rd king of Ibadanland.
NAN reports that the meeting had 10 members of the Olubadan-in-council in attendance, with Ajibola, who had criticised Olakulehin, noticeably absent from the meeting.
Speaking after the meeting, Rashidi Ladoja, Otun Olubadan and an ex-governor of Oyo, said a letter will be sent to the governor to request his consent to the council’s recommendation.
“After the governor’s consent, a day for the coronation will be announced. We thank everyone for the support, as we pray that all of us will be alive to witness the coronation,” he said.

"Tahir Mamman: SSANU, NASU may get half of withheld salaries",https://www.thecable.ng/tahir-mamman-ssanu-nasu-may-get-half-of-withheld-salaries/amp/,TheCable ,"Tahir Mamman, minister of education, says members of the Senior Staff Association of Nigerian Universities (SSANU) and the Non-Academic Staff Union (NASU) may receive half of their withheld salaries if President Bola Tinubu so approves.
The nation’s public universities have witnessed recurring disruptions in academic calendars, as members of staff take turns to protest funding deficits, poor conditions of service, and decay in infrastructure.
Last year, the president waived the “no work, no pay” policy imposed on the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) by the Muhammadu Buhari administration, after lecturers embarked on an eight-month strike. 
The waiver amounted to the federal government paying four months of the withheld eight months pay of the lecturers. 
Speaking during an interview on Channels Television on Wednesday, Mamman said non-academic staff were not on strike for the same duration as ASUU.
He said the issue of the withheld salaries of SSANU and NASU is under consideration, adding that “they were on strike for about four months or so. So, if they are getting payment, it is going to be half of that”.
“There is a court judgment on ‘no work, no pay’. ASUU getting four months’ pay was a discretion and decision by the president. So, it doesn’t automatically transfer to NASU and SSANU but the matter is under consideration,” he said.
“And in any case, the non-academic staff, they were not on strike for the same period with the academic staff — about four months or so. So, if they are getting payment, it is going to be half of that payment, if the president follows his precedent with the academic staff.
“I don’t think it is safe to put a time on it but it’s safer to say that we are on it and we are pushing. I believe what happened was a communication problem, it wasn’t deliberate to exclude them from that benefit.”
Mamman also said the report of the committee probing fake degrees and certificates would be submitted soon.

‘It contravenes procurement act’ — group faults n’assembly over constituency projects,https://www.thecable.ng/it-contravenes-procurement-act-group-faults-national-assembly-over-constituency-projects/amp/,TheCable ,"The Network for the Actualisation of Social Growth and Viable Development (NEFGAD), a public procurement advocacy group, has condemned the interference of the national assembly with budgetary allocations under the guise of constituency projects.
In March, Abdul Ningi, the senator representing Bauchi central alleged that the 2024 budget was padded by N3 trillion.
The senator also alleged that the country is operating two budgets concurrently.
The senate suspended Ningi for three months over his inability to provide evidence to back his allegations.
However, in a letter to President Bola Tinubu on Monday, Akingunola Omoniyi, the head of the group, said project initiation by the lawmakers is beyond the legislative powers of the national assembly as outlined in the Nigerian constitution and the Public Procurement Act 2007.
He advised the president to take immediate action to address violations, noting that the “budget padding” has given the country a bad name.
“The legislative power of the national assembly is to make laws, and such power in itself is not without limit, particularly on public procurement,” the letter reads.
“The power had been sufficiently exercised by the enactment of the extant Public Procurement Act 2007, hence, any conduct of the National Assembly on public contracts outside of the extant Public Procurement Act/regulations amounts to abuse of power/over-legislation.
“The power to initiate any procurement proceeding is purely an executive function and lies with procuring entities/ministerial and extra-ministerial procurement committees and such must be conducted strictly in line with section 18 (a, b, c d, e, f and g) of the Public Procurement Act 2007.
“The provisions mandate procuring entities to engage in the planning of procurement to prepare the needs assessment and evaluation; identifying the goods/works or services required.
“The spirit and letter of the Public Procurement Act underscore the need to organise public procurement to ensure economy of scale, guide against undue interference and ensure that the process maintains a high level of proven system scrutiny and integrity. 
“Hence, any project/procurement item that does not satisfy legally outlined planning and organizational criteria (as in the case of constituency projects which are inserted midway into public procurement proceedings by the national assembly), is utterly defective.”

Speaking during a town hall meeting in Kaduna on Saturday, the governor said he inherited a debt burden of $587 million, N85 billion and 115 contractual liabilities from the el-Rufai administration.
He said his government is unable to pay workers’ salaries due to the inherited debt, adding that the debt burden is eating deep into the state’s coffers.
Reacting to the governor’s statement, Bashir said Sani’s administration is suffering from incompetence and mismanagement.
He berated the governor for “building a banquet hall for N7 billion” while complaining about his inability to pay salaries. 
“The current administration in Kaduna is building a banquet hall for 7BN naira and is lamenting about debt left by the previous administration. These guys have realised that they are wholly incompetent and the only way to mask the nonsense is to deflect,” he wrote on his X page.

Idris said President Tinubu has directed all security agencies to expedite action toward ensuring that school children recently abducted in Kaduna were rescued unhurt and reunited with their families.
The minister advised journalists to desist from amplifying the activities of kidnappers and bandits on the pages of newspapers.
“Mr. President is disturbed that journalists celebrate the activities of kidnappers and bandits on the pages of national dailies,” he said.
“He believes that such publicity encourages the unpatriotic elements.”

‘Narcissistic personality disorder’ — Fayemi berates Afe Babalola for saying ‘previous governors failed Ekiti’,https://www.thecable.ng/hes-suffering-from-narcissistic-personality-disorder-fayemi-berates-afe-babalola-over-previous-governors-failed-ekiti-comment/amp/,TheCable ,"Kayode Fayemi, a former governor of Ekiti, has criticised Afe Babalola, a senior advocate of Nigeria (SAN), for saying previous governors of the state “abandoned the vision of those who laboured for its creation”.
On Monday,  Babalola, without mentioning any name in particular, said former governors of  Ekiti failed to develop the structure that would have propelled the state to higher standards.
Reacting to Babalola’s comment, Fayemi, in an interview with ThisDay, said the statesman may be “suffering from a narcissistic personality disorder” that has prevented him from seeing good in others. 
He said Babalola is partisan in his review of his administration, adding that the 94-year-old lawyer has not been his supporter even during his terms as the governor of the state.
“It is important for people to know this is malicious and not a dispassionate and objective assessment,” Fayemi said. 
“The only thing I brought to public service is my name and I won’t let people take my silence as consent as far as Chief Babalola’s opinion is concerned. 
“He never supported me, he supported Segun Oni in the 2007 election. But that’s fine.
“He has a right to support anyone. I don’t begrudge him for that. Even when I challenged the stolen mandate in 2007, he was Segun Oni’s lawyer in court.
“So, as far as he was concerned, this little David defeated the giant Goliath of Ekiti. Despite that, I embraced him as governor and asked him to chair the Airport Viability Committee, which he was keen on during my first term in office.
“Age is supposed to imbue one with a level of circumspection in what one says, but not this old man who believes he owns Ekiti and any governor who chooses not to grovel before him and shower him with sycophantic adulation of the Almighty Afe Babalola must be brought down.
“Unfortunately, I will not grovel before any human being. Only God is Almighty in my books.
“Chief Afe Babalola has always been unfair to me personally, and to Governors Adebayo and Fayose equally. I can say categorically without any fear of equivocation that every governor that has occupied the exalted seat in Ekiti performed well in the circumstance they operated in.
“They all handed the baton to their successors who took the state further than they met it.
Also, Fayemi said the respected lawyer’s view would not be the yardstick to measure his performance and those of others who have served as Ekiti governors.
“Chief Babalola’s prejudiced view can never be the final word on our times in the office, certainly not on my time in office because I know and the record is crystal clear that I improved the state on every developmental index than I met the state,” he was quoted as saying by PREMIUM TIMES.
“But then, Chief Afe Babalola is an old man and as well brought up Omoluabi, one should grant him the indulgence of failing memory that comes with age.
“I’m, however, glad that he recognised the good in Governor Oyebanji.
“We will continue to applaud his contribution to Ekiti State but I hope Baba is not suffering from a narcissistic personality disorder that prevents him from seeing the good in others even as he relishes his exaggerated sense of self.”

Impeachment: Edo assembly asks chief judge to probe allegations against Philip Shaibu,https://www.thecable.ng/impeachment-edo-assembly-asks-chief-judge-to-probe-allegations-against-philip-shaibu/amp/,TheCable ,"The Edo house of assembly has directed Daniel Okungbowa, the state’s chief judge, to set up a seven-member panel to investigate allegations of gross misconduct against Philip Shaibu, the deputy governor.
Moves to impeach Shaibu as Edo deputy governor intensified after he was declared winner of a parallel governorship primary election that was held at his residence in Benin City, the state capital.
Asue Ighodalo won the election backed by the national working committee (NWC) of the party, while Shaibu was announced the winner of another primary organised by a faction of the PDP in the state.
On March 6, the assembly served  Shaibu with an impeachment notice after a petition against him was signed by 21 of 24 members of the legislative house.
At the assembly’s plenary session on Tuesday, Blessing Agbebaku, speaker of the house, said the seven-day ultimatum given to the deputy governor to respond to the impeachment notice served on him on March 6 has expired.
Agbebaku said due to the evasion of service by the Shaibu, the house ordered for the notice to be published in two newspapers.
Subsequently, Charity  Aiguobarueghan, the majority leader of the house, moved the motion asking the chief judge to put in place the seven-member panel.
The motion was seconded by Nicholas Asonsere, the representative of the Ikpoba/Okha constituency.

On March 15, President Bola Tinubu appointed the former executive of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) to lead the programme which is aimed at tackling youth restiveness, destruction of crude oil pipelines, oil theft, and insecurity in the Niger Delta region.
He was welcomed to the commission’s headquarters in Abuja on Monday by Ita Henshaw, the technical assistant to Barry Ndiomu, the former interim administrator.
Otuaro said his mission was to render quality service to the region without room for personal gains.
“First and foremost, I greet everybody here. I thank Mr President for entrusting me with the opportunity to serve at this time. I need everybody’s cooperation here to take this programme to greatness,” he said.
“My appeal here is as from today we should back the crowd and face the job. I need everyone’s cooperation so we don’t disappoint the President, the NSA, the people of the Niger Delta and Nigeria as a whole. 
“I  believe in this country. Everything about me is in this country and it is also in the Niger Delta.
“This assignment is for our people, for the country and humanity. We are bringing the programme closer to the people. We will not use it to pursue abstract things. 
“We will streamline whatever that we know that is giving us the load to provide excuses, we must streamline some things and we’ll work together. 
“I will not disappoint my people, I will not disappoint Mr President and National Security Adviser who gave me this appointment. I am not here to pursue personal goals, I am begging everybody to be the same with me.”
The amnesty programme was initiated and signed into law in 2009, to stem youth restiveness, agitation, and ruination of oil processing infrastructure in Nigeria’s oil-rich Niger Delta region.

Part of the mandate is to disarm, demobilise and reintegrate ex-agitators back into society.

‘It amounts to insensitivity’ — Peter Obi slams accountant-general’s office for holding workshop in London,https://www.thecable.ng/it-amounts-to-insensitivity-peter-obi-slams-accountant-generals-office-for-holding-workshop-in-london/amp/,TheCable ,"Peter Obi, presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP) in the 2023 elections, has condemned the financial management workshop held in London by the office of the accountant-general of the federation (OAGF).
The workshop was held from March 4 to March 9 at the Copthorne Tara Hotel, Kensington, in London.
Speaking on the development, Obi said the “function abroad amounts to insensitivity on the part of the government.”
He said government officials should not be indulging in luxury and extravagance at the expense of the common citizen amid the economic hardship in the country.
The former Anambra governor said the initiative by the OAGF entrenches a culture of elitism and detachment from the realities faced by ordinary Nigerians.
“Given the prevailing hardship in the country and the pitiable state of our national currency, any public function abroad amounts to insensitivity on the part of the government and any agency or individuals involved,” he said.
“First and foremost, it represents a blatant disregard for fiscal responsibility and prudent expenditure of public funds. At a time when Nigeria is grappling with economic challenges, including inflation, currency devaluation, and a widening budget deficit, it is utterly irresponsible to squander taxpayer money on extravagant overseas workshops.
“The resources allocated for such purposes should be directed towards addressing pressing domestic needs, such as healthcare, education, infrastructure, and poverty alleviation.
“Furthermore, holding a workshop in London sends the wrong message to the Nigerian people and the international community. It perpetuates the perception of government officials indulging in luxury and extravagance at the expense of the common citizen.
“It fosters a culture of elitism and detachment from the realities faced by ordinary Nigerians, who struggle daily to make ends meet amidst rising living costs and limited access to essential services.
“Additionally, holding a workshop in London raises concerns about transparency and accountability in government procurement processes.”
The politician said there must be full disclosure and justification for why London was chosen as the venue, as well as how the selection of vendors and contractors was made.
Obi said any hint of impropriety or favouritism in awarding contracts for such events “must be thoroughly investigated and addressed”.

Tinubu approves establishment of Africa CDC regional centre in Nigeria,https://www.thecable.ng/tinubu-approves-establishment-of-africa-cdc-regional-centre-in-nigeria/amp/,TheCable ,"President Bola Tinubu has approved the establishment of the regional coordinating centre (RCC) of the Africa Centres for Disease Control (Africa CDC) in Nigeria.
The Africa CDC is the health arm of the African Union (AU) designed to strengthen the continent’s public health institutions and systems’ capacities.
It is also to respond effectively to public health threats and outbreaks based on evidence-based policies, programmes, and interventions.
The Africa CDC currently has five regional coordinating centres in Gabon, Kenya, Nigeria, and Zambia.
In a statement on Thursday, Ajuri Ngelale, the presidential spokesperson, said Tinubu’s approval for the establishment of the Centre is anchored on his effort to convey Nigeria’s commitment to regional and global health security.
“The centre will also bring with it enormous socio-economic benefits in the form of enhancing aggregate national productivity and reversing human capacity drain, even as the ability of indigenous medical professionals and scientists will be bolstered to respond adequately to old, recent, and emerging diseases, not only in Nigeria but across the continent,” the statement reads. 
Last month, Jean Kaseya, director-general (DG) of the Africa CDC, said the organisation is working towards a future where health security is not a privilege.
Kaseya said while the COVID-19 pandemic tested the organisation’s strength, its strategic and unified response facilitated the administration of over 2.5 million vaccine doses in Africa.

Anambra condemns brutalisation of ‘notorious thug’ by anti-touting officers,https://www.thecable.ng/anambra-condemns-brutalisation-of-notorious-thug-by-anti-touting-officers/amp/,TheCable ,"The Anambra government has vowed to prosecute the operatives of the Special Anambra Anti-Touting Squad (SASA) that brutalised one Wilfred Ezike, an alleged notorious thug, in the state.
On Tuesday, a video of Ezike, otherwise known as Mgbilimgba, being brutalised by the operatives of the anti-touting squad went viral.
The operatives, whose faces were not caught on camera, tortured the alleged thug with a pestle until his ankles bled and was subsequently admitted into a hospital. 
Reacting to the incident, on Wednesday, Chikodi Anarah, the commissioner for homeland affairs, condemned the inhumane act of the operatives.
The commissioner identified Ejike as “a major kingpin of touts in whose hands people have gone through hell”, but added that actions of the anti-tout officers must be confined to the law.
“I have been alerted to a viral video on the arrest and manhandling of one Wilfred Ezike, also known as Mgbiligba, by SASA operatives. I feel bad that an incident of that nature took place. I have felt bad all day since somebody posted the video to me,” his statement reads.
“Indeed, some people are unrepentantly committed to various criminalities based on which innocent citizens remain in miserable conditions running their legitimate day-to-day life, but we must handle human beings according to prescriptions of the law, no matter their offence.
“Our governement is law-abiding and that is why we must fish out the SASA operatives involved in the incident under reference and punish them accordingly.
“It is also true that we are resolute to stamp out ‘Agberos’, but that must happen within the confines of the laws of the land. Interestingly, people have been commenting and reacting. This shows life in an organised democracy.
“Some of them allege various levels of atrocities committed by Wilfred Ezike for which he ought to have been more severely manhandled and brought to book, while counter-narratives insist that he should not be manhandled at all. For me, and the government of Anambra state, nothing justifies brutality, which is why we will punish the erring operatives.
“General comments have also expressed opinions that Wilfred had been prominent in fighting previous administrations to a standstill in their effort to curb the state of touts and their activities.”
Last year, Charles Soludo, governor of Anambra, launched the state anti-touting squad to tackle the activities of touts in Anambra.

The senate plenary on Tuesday turned into a rowdy session over Ningi’s allegation that the 2024 budget was padded by N3 trillion.
Over the weekend, Ningi alleged that “huge damage” has been done to the entire country through the budget.
The lawmaker further alleged that “apart from what the national assembly did on the floor, there was another budget that was done underground which we didn’t know.”
Speaking during an open session, Akpabio said the senate has lost the respect of the citizens due to the unverifiable statement made by the senator.
“Nigerians are bashing the senate. Many Nigerians will never in future come back to respect this chamber. The integrity of this chamber has been damaged and we wanted you to repair it with your speech,” the senate president said.
“Instead of that, you said you have more documents to prove what you are saying. This thing is in the public glare. I am still waiting to receive full details up to this moment. If you had given me full details, I would have known what you know.
“So far, what you know is only known to you, it is not known to anyone else. I don’t know how you rushed to the press carrying different versions. The social media is very fast. From Canada, the United States, everywhere, the story was budget padding by the senate.”
Meanwhile, the senate has suspended Ningi for three months after a motion on privilege moved by Solomon Adeola, senator representing Ogun west.

In 2021, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, governor of Lagos, announced that the state government would construct a green rail line at the Lekki free trade zone to complement the infrastructural development in that area.
A year later, the government said it had completed the expression of interest and was on the verge of concluding the feasibility study for the investment on the 68-kilometre rail line.
However, on Monday, a popular social media account claimed that the state government had signed a contract for the construction of the green metro line.
“The Lagos Green Metro Line contract is officially signed! This 68km rail will traverse key areas like Marina, Victoria Island, Lekki Phase 1, Ajah, Lekki 2, Ogombo, Elepetu, Eluju, Lekki Airport, and Lekki Free Trade Zone,” the claim reads.
“Projections indicate it will transport 500,000+ passengers daily initially, with numbers expected to exceed a million by 2031.”
The post, which was made by Lagospedia, a user account on X, has garnered over 50,000 likes, and over 200 reposts on the social media platform.
Reacting to the claim, Jubril Gawat, senior special assistant to the governor of Lagos on new media, said the contract for the construction of the rail has not been signed.
‘Not Yet. What was signed was the second phase of the red line which links the red line from the Ebute Metta station to connect the blue line at the national theatre,” Gawat responded to the claim on X.

Falana to FG: Tell Nigerians if fuel subsidy has been restored,https://www.thecable.ng/falana-to-fg-tell-nigerians-if-fuel-subsidy-has-been-restored/amp/,TheCable ,"Femi Falana, senior advocate of Nigeria (SAN), has challenged the federal government to confirm or deny if petrol subsidy has been restored.
During his inauguration on May 29, 2023, President Bola Tinubu announced the removal of the petrol subsidy.
This development has worsened the living conditions of Nigerians, as the disposable income of citizens continues to decline due to inflation.
In a statement on Sunday, Falana said Robert Dickerman, chief executive officer of Pinnacle Oil, claimed at a conference in Abuja that the federal government still pays N1 trillion every month for petrol subsidy.
The human rights activist said instead of urging Nigerians to continue to endure the hardship caused by the removal of subsidies on petrol, the president should go public about the state of the economic policy.
“During his inauguration on May 29, 2003, President Bola Tinubu announced the end of fuel subsidies and total deregulation of petroleum products. But at the recently concluded Nigeria International Energy Summit (NIES) held in Abuja, the Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director of Pinnacle Oil and Gas Limited, Mr. Robert Dickerman revealed that the Nigerian Government still pays N1 trillion every month for petrol subsidy,” the statement reads.
“Mr. Dickerman who made the disclosure while participating in a panel discussion disclosed that a significant subsidy is still in place, adding that this has contributed to the affordable price of the product and potentially fueling smuggling activities to neighbouring countries. 
“On its own part, the World Bank has alleged partial return of fuel subsidy in a report presented in Abuja last December. In justifying its claim then, the World Bank said that based on the official exchange rate then, the petrol should sell for around N750 per litre and not the N650 currently being paid by Nigerians.
“Curiously, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation Limited has not deemed it fit to deny the serious allegation that fuel subsidy has been restored. Since there is no provision for fuel subsidy in the 2023 and 2024 Appropriation Acts, the federal government should, without any further delay, confirm or deny the serious allegation and end the opacity surrounding the importation of fuel from foreign countries.”
Falana also cited a February 2024 report by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) advising the Nigerian government to completely phase out petrol and electricity subsidies in the country despite the president’s announcement.

However, Theophilus Alaye, IYC president, in a statement on Thursday said over the past two weeks, the neighbouring communities of Eket and Esit Eket have directed both physical and verbal threats towards the people of Ibeno.
Alaye said the remapping process introduced by the administration of the former governor of the state Udom Emmanuel, was designed to “promote an ethics war between the Ijaws and its neighbours in the state.”
“It is worthy of note that the people of Eket allocated Ibeno lands to themselves, while the land in question is before a court and there is an injunction restricting them from accessing the land,” he said.
“These provocative actions have been treated with kid gloves by the governor of the state and we see it as a move to promote an ethics war between the Ijaws and its neighbours in the state.
“The Ijaw nation will and cannot fold their arms when their sons and daughters’ lives and property are under severe attack by other ethnic groups.”
“Remapping of local government areas is not within the powers of a state government and as such the Ijaw nation will never accept any politically motivated remapping and further balkanisation of our people for whatever reasons.”

Wielding placards with sundry inscriptions, the workers called for an end to hunger, poverty and insecurity in the country.
They also said the current minimum wage cannot buy a 50kg bag of rice and demanded for a review.
Massive security was deployed to strategic locations within Kaduna metropolis to curtail any attempts to hijack the protest.
The protest was peaceful and lasted for an hour.
Meanwhile, Nkeiruka Onyejeocha, minister of state for labour and employment, had said there has been substantial progress on the agreements reached with the labour unions.

Presidency: NLC protest needless… legitimate concerns are being addressed,https://www.thecable.ng/presidency-nlc-protest-needless-legitimate-concerns-are-being-addressed/,TheCable,"Ajuri Ngelale, special adviser to President Bola Tinubu on media and publicity, has described the ongoing protest by the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) as a needless one.
On Tuesday, members of organised labour took to the streets of cities nationwide to protest the economic hardship and spiralling inflation confronting the citizenry.
During an interview on TVC, the president’s spokesperson said the federal government is doing everything possible to ameliorate the hardship in the land. 
“Any labour union that is speaking to the concerns of Nigerian families, the pains that are being felt by our people, is absolutely free to do so. It is right that Nigerians speak up in difficult situations,” he said.
“And the government has been doing everything possible to alleviate those concerns.
“But we also want to separate the legitimate concerns being expressed by some of the labour unions from people trying to leverage some of the situations in the country to achieve a political agenda.
“We have seen the Trade Union Congress (TUC) pull out of the purported nationwide protest. We have seen the National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS) pull out of the protest. There is no unanimity behind what NLC is trying to do.
“I believe all of the legitimate concerns being raised by the unions are being tackled by the administration of President Bola Tinubu.”
Despite a last minute intervention, the federal government was unable to convince the NLC to halt the nationwide protest slated for Tuesday and Wednesday.
On February 22, Nkeiruka Onyejeocha, minister of state for labour and employment, said there has been substantial progress on the agreements reached with the labour unions.

Members of organised labour will mobilise to the streets on February 27 and 28 in protest against the current economic hardship in the country. 
On February 16, NLC declared a two-day nationwide protest over the economic hardship in the country.
In a statement on Monday, Aboki Danjuma, the commissioner of police in Imo, said operatives of the command have been deployed across the state to ensure maximum safety of the residents.
The commissioner said while citizens have the right to protest, police would not tolerate any form of violence.

“CP Danjuma therefore, calls on all participants to conduct themselves peacefully and warns that anyone who infringes on the fundamental human rights of another or causes any breakdown of law and order during the procession will be made to face the full wrath of the law.
“He assured that police operatives will accompany the peaceful protesters throughout the procession, as agreed with the NLC leaders in the state.”

On Sunday, the defence headquarters debunked a viral report which claimed that the guards brigade, a unit that protects the seat of power, has been put on high alert over a purported coup plot, caused by the economic crisis pervading the land. 
Last week, Christopher Musa, chief of defence staff, warned against the clamour for a coup, saying while the “country has been experiencing some challenges”, calls for a putsch were way out of order.
In a statement on Monday, Gbenga Osho, the convener of ADD, described the “coup mongers” as “wicked and retrogressive”, adding that the calls are aimed at derailing the military’s efforts against banditry and terrorism in the country.
Osho said the persons calling for the overthrow of President Bola Tinubu’s government are beneficiaries of the insecurity plaguing the country.
“We are glad that time and time again, the present leadership of the Armed Forces of Nigeria under Gen. Christopher Musa has said the military is loyal to the constitution and President Bola Tinubu,” he said.
“We in ADD urge Nigerians to continue to support the military under Gen Musa who have shown determination to quickly restore peace and stability and remain loyal to the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.”

The suspects were arraigned in a high court sitting in Yenagoa, the state capital, on Friday.
Asinim Butswat, the police spokesperson, identified the suspected kidnappers as Lucky Oghenebrume (53) and Omobowho Okpowodo (52).
Butswat said both men were arrested by officers of Operation Puff Adder in November 2023 at Mbiama community in Rivers state.
A police prosecutor who spoke in court said Oghenebrume was the brain behind the attempt to kidnap the governor’s brother.
He told the court that the suspect was on the wanted list of the Bayelsa police command.
The prosecutor said Oghenebrume was involved in the abduction of one Fyneman in the Sagbama area of Bayelsa, noting that N50 million was paid as ransom.
He added that the second suspect, Okpowodo, owns a motor mechanic workshop where the governor’s brother repairs his vehicles.
He said Okpowodo was reportedly overheard last year planning to abduct Ayama on his way from Ekeremor LGA.
The two suspects pleaded not guilty to the charges against them by the police.
Timipre Songi, the presiding judge, adjourned the case till February, 27. 
In 2016, Nancy Dickson, younger sister of Seriake Dickson, former governor of Bayelsa state, was abducted from her business place in Yenagoa.

"Edo guber: I’m authentic PDP candidate, says Shaibu",https://www.thecable.ng/edo-guber-im-authentic-pdp-candidate-says-shaibu/,TheCable,"Philip Shaibu, Edo deputy governor, says he is the authentic candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for the Edo governorship election.
The deputy governor was declared winner of a factional governorship primary election that reportedly held at his residence in Benin City, the state capital, on Thursday.
Asue Ighodalo was also announced winner of another PDP primary exercise which took place at the Samuel Ogbemudia stadium.
During an interview on Sunrise Daily, a Channels Television programme, Shaibu said the election that produced Ighodalo was marred by irregularities and disregard for the party’s constitution.
“In the coming days, we will know who amongst us is authentic. By the time we give you the breakdown of the people that voted, you would see it was an arranged election for Ighodalo,” he said.
“I, the winner of this election, have already sent my team to reach out to Mr. Ighodalo so he can join me and work together.
“I am the authentic candidate and as we move on you will realise that.
“The primary process that produced Ighodalo was faulty. Yesterday, a group of delegates said they won the delegates election held on February 4 and they showed their names but they were rejected.
“We have serious gap as far as leadership is concerned and that is why we have this confusion.
“Those delegates insisted that they must have their election and they voted for me.
“Everything that took place yesterday was orgnaised by the state arm of the PDP, and that contradicts our agreement at stakeholders meeting, and it also contradicts our constitution that says it is the national that organises the election.”
Shaibu added that: “PDP should be extremely careful with Edo… let us not get to a point where we may not even field a candidate in this election”.
Ighodalo has maintained that the primary election he won was the authentic one because it was monitored by members of the party’s national working committee (NWC) and officials of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).
The Edo governorship poll has been slated for September 21, 2024.

On Sunday, gunmen abducted an unidentified number of passengers, including the body of the deceased at Umuoka community in Udi LGA, Enugu state.
The victims were said to be heading to Enugu from Lagos for the burial of the late Ugwuanyi when their bus was attacked.
The kidnappers demanded N50 million ransom for the release of those abducted, including the body of the deceased.
However, on Wednesday, a family member confirmed to TheCable that the decomposed body of the deceased was recovered from a forest near the 9th-mile corner in Udi LGA of the state.
The source said the body was found by a troop of soldiers combing the forest on Tuesday morning.
The family member said the soldiers took the body to a nearby police station for onward deposit at a morgue but was rejected.
The source said the soldiers reached out to the deceased family through one of the retrieved phones of the kidnapped victims.
“We were running about seeking help on how to get the corpse and our other brothers released from captivity when the number called,” the source said.
“It turned out to be a soldier and he told us how they found the corpse. He told us to come to the police station at 9th Mile, where they would hand over the corpse to be deposited to a mortuary.
“But as we headed to Enugu to meet them, the army man called again that the police had rejected the corpse. We pleaded with them to help us deposit it to any nearby mortuary so that we will meet them there.”

On the other members and driver who are still in captivity, the source said the family and community are yet to raise the money demanded by the kidnappers.

"Protesters march against detention of Ahmed, ex-Kwara governor, at EFCC office",https://www.thecable.ng/protesters-march-against-detention-of-ahmed-ex-kwara-governor-at-efcc-office/,TheCable,"Some protesters on Wednesday marched to the Ilorin zonal office of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) over the detention of Abdulfatah Ahmed, a former governor of Kwara state.
The protesters identified themselves as members of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the state.
Ahmed was invited by the anti-graft agency on Monday to its zonal office in Ilorin, the state capital over N3 billion spent during his administration.
Ahmed was the governor of Kwara between 2011 and 2019.
Before he became governor, he served as commissioner for finance in the administration of Bukola Saraki, his predecessor.
This is the third time Ahmed has been invited by the anti-graft agency since he left office in 2019.
In May 2021, he was grilled at the EFCC’s headquarters in Abuja over allegations of fraud.
The second time was in December 2020, when he was at the commission’s office in Ilorin to clarify certain transactions and decisions he took as governor.
The leader of the protestors who spoke with journalists, said the former governor has been denied access to his wife and lawyers since he was detained.
“His wife was not allowed to check on him, even his lawyers were prevented from seeing him. We the masses and party loyalists are prevented from him,” he said.
“When Governor Ahmed was in government, he declared the allocation of the state every month. Everybody knew what was going in and coming out. That is transparency.
“If EFCC has a case against him, they should go to court and not take the law into their own hands. Instead of going ex-governor Ahmed, they should go after the governor.”

The newspaper, which focuses on building an egalitarian society based on the principles of justice and fundamental human rights, is published by Naija Times Communications Limited.
In a statement on Tuesday, Braimah said over 9,900 sustained attacks have hit the website.
The publisher said the media company was recently approached by a bank’s representative to pull down a story but the request was declined. 
“The unrestrained attacks were aimed at undermining the integrity of the online newspaper. In their desperation to crash the website, the hackers used multiple IP addresses,” the statement reads.
“They also made several unsuccessful attempts to compromise the backend of the website as they tried to gain access.
“Recently, Naija Times was approached by an agent who claimed to be a journalist and PR consultant, representing one of the banks, to pull down a story, but the Board of Editors refused.
“We cannot immediately confirm whether the cyber attacks have anything to do with the bank’s request, which we turned down.
“Our tech team has been diligent and proactive in responding to the mindless attacks by ring-fencing the website and enhancing its security architecture.”

Police: Serial kidnapper who killed Rivers DPO is dead,https://www.thecable.ng/police-serial-kidnapper-who-killed-rivers-dpo-is-dead/,TheCable,"The police command in Rivers says Gift Okpara, a serial kidnapper otherwise known as 2Baba, has been killed by a joint security operation in the state.
Last year, Siminalayi Fubara, governor of Rivers, placed a N100 million bounty on the suspected kidnapper and his gang for the murder of Bako Angbashim, a superintendent of police.
The divisional police officer (DPO) was killed when his team ran into an ambush laid by the gang.
At the time, the governor said the suspected criminal had established camps in the Ahoada area in Ahoada East LGA and was responsible for the resurgence of violent crimes, including kidnapping and terrorism.
Speaking on the matter since the bounty was announced, Grace Iringe-Koko, spokesperson of the command, said a joint operation of the police, army, navy, air force, Department of State Services (DSS) and Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC), raided the gang’s hideout on February 17.
Iringe-Koko said despite confirmation of his death, efforts are ongoing to recover the corpse.
“Despite extensive efforts, 2Baba and his gang managed to evade capture by retreating deeper into the forest, leveraging the difficult terrain and strategically positioning informants to monitor security forces’ movements,” the spokesperson said.
“On Dec. 3, information indicated that 2Baba frequented a nearby community via canoe. Despite a two-week surveillance to ambush him, he abruptly ceased visits, seemingly aware of our operation.
“On Dec. 6, 2Baba’s executioner, Faithful Joseph, who was seen wielding an AK47 in a viral gang video, was arrested at his Etche local government area hideout but succumbed from gunshot wounds sustained during his failed escape attempt.
“On January 19, operatives successfully deployed advanced technology, revolutionising their approach in the operation, leading to the gathering of crucial intelligence.
“On February 10, the command shared information with the Air Force, and at about 7:30 p.m., the Air Force executed an aerial assault, causing significant casualties and injuries to 2Baba and his gang.
“But on February 17 at about noon, the gang attacked Okogbe Town and Odiokwu community, destroying several pipelines.
“On the same day, a raid on 2Baba’s new camp ensued, and despite a fierce gun battle, the gang members escaped, but intelligence later confirmed 2Baba’s death.”
The spokesperson said an Ak47 rifle, a G3 rifle, a scorpion rifle, a locally made double barrel gun and two locally made pistols, were recovered from the gang’s hideout.
Other items retrieved included a one-cut-to-size double-barreled gun, a bulletproof vest, thirteen pieces of dynamite, five rounds of .9mm live ammunition, army camouflage, assorted charms, a human skull and a jack-knife.

NAN reports that Kolapo Oladeji, the coordinating comptroller, said customs officers impounded the trucks at the Kajji community on the Sokoto-Kebbi road.
He said the truckloads of food items were heading to neighbouring Niger Republic through the Kebbi border. 
“We will leave no stone unturned to block food smuggling out of the country because of the current situation,” he said. 
“We all know that prices of food items have skyrocketed because of the activities of some Nigerians.

“We will continue to trail them and block their routes. And whoever is caught in this infamous act will face the full wrath of the law.”
Nigeria is grappling with food inflation and economic hardship. The federal government recently announced the release of 42,000 tons of grains from the strategic reserves, to alleviate the hunger pervading the land.

“These drugs are hazardous to the health of our people. Some of them even carried fake National Agency For Food, Drugs Administration and Control (NAFDAC) registration and expiring dates,” he said.

On Monday, Oluchi Opara, national treasurer of the LP, accused Julius Abure, national chair of the party, of misappropriating N3.5 billion belonging to the party.
She said the N3.5 billion was proceeds of sale of forms and fundraising activities in the buildup to the 2023 elections.
The national treasurer said she was compelled to raise the alarm because the “internal mechanisms” of the party failed to hold the party chairman to account. 
In its reaction, the party said Opara was being influenced by “external forces” intent on destroying the LP, and suspended her. 
In a press conference on Thursday, Obi who was accompanied by Aisha Yesufu, a member of his 2023 campaign team, said he is not involved in the accounting of the party’s finances.
He added that he is not a signatory to any of the party’s campaign accounts. 
“I’m not involved in the party accounting. I’m not part of the party management. Even the campaign accounts, I’m not signatory to any or any groups’ accounts,” he said.
“The money people gave me was paid into one account or the other which was properly managed because I knew there would be days like this. I assure you, we will account for everything.
“That is why I am calling on every member of the public with leads to where they think these millions and billions were paid into, or given to people in cash, to come forward.

A video clip uploaded on X on Friday, showed the girls inside a room being interrogated by an unidentified man.
The girls were aged between 15 and 18 years old, they stated in the clip.
Seven of the girls said they hail from Imo State, South-east Nigeria while three of them said they are from Jos in Plateau State, North-central Nigeria.

The girls, three of which are siblings, said a brother to one of them trafficked them to Ghana and that their mobile phones were seized on arrival into the country.
Asked what they do, one of the girls responded: “Prostitute work.”
“They pay you (for prostitution)?” the unidentified man further probed.
“No. They don’t pay us. Any money you make (from prostitution), they take it,” the girl replied.
The man condemned the development, saying the children in that age bracket ought to be in school, not prostitution.
‘They pay me 200 cedis daily’
In another video clip uploaded on the same X handle, the suspected trafficker admitted trafficking the girls to the country.
The unidentified trafficker, who is a Nigerian, said he received 200 Ghana Cedis daily as proceeds from the girls’ prostitution.
The amount is about N20,000 or $14, according to the current exchange rate.
It is not clear if the 200 Ghana Cedis is the daily value received for each or all of the girls.
He claimed the girls told him that they were up to 20 years old.
Arrest
The Chairperson of the Nigerians in the Diaspora Organisation, Callistus Elozieuwa, was seen in another clip, saying the suspect has been arrested.
“We got a tip-off yesterday that one Nigerian guy brought these ladies here, beat them up, maltreated them and sent them for prostitution. So, we sent our rescue team to go for the girls.
“We went there this morning, fortunately we were able to get all of them from the guy’s room. And we were able to apprehend the guy. He’s in police custody here,” Mr Elozieuwa said.
‘We’ll take custody of the girls’
The spokesperson of the National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons, Zachariah Duada, told PREMIUM TIMES on Friday night that the agency was already working to take custody of the girls.
Prohibited in Nigeria
Nigeria in 2015 enacted the Trafficking in Persons (Prohibition) Enforcement and Administration Act which outlawed all acts of human trafficking in the country.
The Act prescribes a minimum penalty of between five and 10 years imprisonment and a fine of N1 million for the trafficking of children, depending on the purpose of such trafficking.
Several persons have been convicted of child trafficking across the country.
The Kano State High Court, in July 2021, sentenced a man, Paul Owne, to 91 years in prison for kidnapping and trafficking of children in the state for sale in Onitsha, Anambra State.
A Federal High Court in Port-Harcourt, River State, in 2019, sentenced three persons to a combined 12 years imprisonment for trafficking a two-year-old male child and one other child.

Peter Obi’s ex-campaign chief Doyin Okupe says Tinubu best for president,https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/more-news/701879-peter-obis-ex-campaign-chief-doyin-okupe-says-tinubu-best-for-president.html,PremiumTimes,"Doyin Okupe, a former director general of the Peter Obi 2023 Presidential Campaign Organisation, has said he now considers President Bola Tinubu of the All Progressives Congress (APC), who he campaigned against during last year’s electioneering, to be the best presidential candidate.
Mr Okupe appeared on Channels Television prime time programme, Politics Today, on Friday.
He said with his performance as governor of Lagos State between 1999 and 2007, Mr Tinubu was more competent to serve as Nigeria’s president compared with his rival presidential candidates, including Mr Obi.
“Let me tell you, of all the people that actually ran for president in 2023, you know by benefit of hindsight, Bola Tinubu is the best,” said Mr Okupe, while fielding questions from the Channels TV anchor, Seun Okinbaloye.

“I’m telling you, by benefit of hindsight, I have seen Peter Obi with Atiku Abubakar…Many people are not aware (that) I knew Bola Tinubu so many years ago. We have interacted.”

Mr Okupe served as the director-general of the Labour Party presidential candidate Peter Obi’s campaign organisation until he stepped down following his conviction for money laundering in December 2022.
The Federal High Court in Abuja sentenced Mr Okupe to jail for “money laundering and criminal diversion” of about N702 million from the Office of the National Security Adviser (ONSA) while he was serving as an aide to then President Goodluck Jonathan in 2012. The NSA office was then headed by Sambo Dasuki.
Mr Okupe, however, avoided going to jail by paying the fine option offered by the court.
The Ogun State-born medical doctor turned politician started distancing himself from Mr Obi and his Labour Party in the aftermath of last year’s presidential election won by Mr Tinubu.
In January 2024, he defected from the Labour Party, citing ideological differences.
Mr Okupe had served under the Peoples Democractic Party (PDP)-led administrations of then-Presidents Olusegun Obasanjo and Jonathan as a presidential spokesperson.
Okupe’s political trajectory
Mr Okupe has crisscrossed various political parties since Nigeria’s return to civilian rule in 1999.
He started the Fourth Republic as a member of the PDP, serving as then-President Obasanjo’s special assistant on media and publicity. In 2002, he unsuccessfully ran for the party’s Ogun State governorship ticket.
In 2012, then-President Jonathan appointed him as his senior special assistant on public affairs.
It was when he was serving in this capacity that he took the money that led to his trial and conviction for money laundering from the NSA office.
In July 2017, he left the the PDP to join Accord Party.
Barely a year after, Accord Party expelled him and he subsequently rejoined the PDP.
On rejoining the PDP, he served as the media publicist for the presidential campaign of Bukola Saraki, who was seeking to pick the party’s presidential ticket ahead of the 2019 presidential election. Mr Saraki ended up losing the ticket to former Nigeria’s Vice President, Atiku Abubakar, who also ran unsuccessfully for president like Mr Obi in 2023.
Ahead of the 2023 presidential election, Mr Okupe joined the Labour Party, and stood in as its presidential candidate’s running mate until the substantive vice-presidential candidate was picked.
He remained in Labour Party until January 2024, when he resigned his membership of the party.
Reacting to his defection, the Labour Party said it was unsurprising for a traditional politician like him to move from one party to another, including the ones he previously abandoned.

"Court remands traditional ruler, four others over alleged murder of security operatives",https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/top-news/701521-court-remands-traditional-ruler-four-others-over-alleged-murder-of-security-operatives.html,PremiumTimes,"A traditional ruler in Enugu State has been remanded for alleged involvement in the murder of two police operatives and three Neighbourhood Watch Group members in the state.
The traditional ruler, Herbert Ukuta, was arraigned on Thursday alongside four others allegedly involved in the murder of the operatives.
Mr Ukuta is the traditional ruler of Igga Community in the Uzo-Uwani Local Government Area of the state.
The police spokesperson in Enugu State, Daniel Ndukwe, disclosed this in a statement on Thursday night.
Mr Ndukwe, a deputy superintendent of police, identified four other suspects as Festus Okonkwo, Ofodile Titus Henry, Sunday Ugwu and Obinna Ayogu – all males.
Murder of the security operatives
Mr Ndukwe said the victims were ambushed and murdered on 3 May by “a large group of armed criminal elements harboured” in the Igga Community.
The spokesperson said the attack occurred when a combined security team comprising three police operatives and four members of the Neighbourhood Watch Group were providing security for a team of investors from Lagos State on a tour of a proposed agricultural investment site in the community.
He claimed that the bodies of the victims were later recovered following revelations by the traditional ruler and others earlier arrested and detained on court orders.
Arraignment
Mr Ndukwe said the suspects were arraigned on Thursday and remanded at the Nigeria Correctional Centre in Enugu.
“They were arraigned for the offences of conspiracy, terrorism, and murder upon being found culpable during investigations,” he said.
The police spokesperson did not mention the court where the suspects were arraigned.
But PREMIUM TIMES gathered that they were arraigned at Enugu North Magistrate Court I by the police in Enugu State.
Mr Ukuta, the traditional ruler, had been in detention at the police facility for over one month without trial.
This newspaper gathered that the arraignment of Mr Ukuta and others came barely 24 hours after the Inspector-General of Police queried the Commissioner of Police in the state, Kanayo Uzuegbu, for detaining the monarch for over one month without trial.
Assurance for justice
Mr Uzuegbu reiterated the resolve of the police to prosecute those involved in the murder, Mr Ndukwe said.
The police commissioner cautioned social media users allegedly publishing “falsehoods” about the case.
He vowed that the police would not be distracted by such “ugly” campaigns.

NAFDAC seizes illegal drugs worth N107 million in Abuja motor parks,https://www.premiumtimesng.com/health/health-news/699500-nafdac-seizes-illegal-drugs-worth-n107-million-in-abuja-motor-parks.html,PremiumTimes,"The National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) has cracked down on motor parks and confiscated illegal drugs worth 107 million in Abuja, Nigeria’s Federal Capital Territory (FCT).
NAFDAC disclosed this on X stating that the operation, “coordinated by the Kaduna and Abuja I&E/FTF offices, targeted illegal drug sales at Area 1 Motor Park; Dunamis Market, Garki; Zuba Market; Nyanya Motor Park, and Asokoro, over a two-day period.”
It also noted that the seized items include “ Tramadol 225mg, Rohypnol, Diazepam, Cod Amol, aphrodisiacs, and codeine syrups.”
The agency gave the estimated cost value of the seized drugs as more than ₦107 million.

According to NAFDAC, its Investigation and Enforcement and the Federal Task Force Directorate acted on intelligence from the Department of State Services (DSS) and conducted a major raid on drug hawkers at motor parks and markets in the FCT.

It further stated that during the raid, 20 suspects were arrested and over 50 wares of illegal and dangerous drugs were confiscated.
“The arrested individuals are under investigation, and all confiscated products will be destroyed. This raid is part of an ongoing effort to rid public spaces of illegal drug hawking and ensure public safety,” the agency said.
Similar efforts
PREMIUM TIMES recently reported that NAFDAC has arrested drug hawkers and seized drugs worth N50 million in Apapa, Lagos State.
The items were seized by NAFDAC’s investigation and enforcement directorate during a targeted raid on drug hawkers.
It noted that the seized products include aphrodisiac and other illicit drugs
“A wide range of illicit drugs were confiscated, including aphrodisiacs, narcotic substances (including tramadol), antibiotics, and over-the-counter medications,” the agency stated.
The agency said the operation was part of its ongoing efforts to combat the distribution and sale of unauthorised pharmaceuticals.
“The individuals arrested will be prosecuted accordingly, and the confiscated drugs are slated for destruction,” it said.

WAEC speaks on ongoing WASSCE amidst proposed workers’ strike,https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/700165-waec-speaks-on-ongoing-wassce-amidst-proposed-workers-strike.html,PremiumTimes,"The West African Examinations Council (WAEC) has said the indefinite strike announced by Nigeria’s foremost labour unions would not affect the conduct of the ongoing West African Senior School Certificate Examination (WASSCE).
In an internal memo addressed to the principals of schools participating in the 2024 WASSCE, WAEC said the conduct of the internal examination continues irrespective of the strike.
“The attention of Management has been drawn to a notice of the Commencement of Indefinite Strike by NLC and TUC effective Monday, 3rd June 2024. Please be formally informed that the conduct of WASSCE SC 2024 goes on as scheduled,” the examination board said in a statement signed by the Ekiti Branch Controller for WAEC National Office, identified as T A Lawson.
WAEC said as much as it shares in the concerns of the unions and the generality of Nigerians, the examination is going on across the member Countries of WAEC and “the Nigerian child should not be put to a disadvantage of missing the exam.”

“For the aforesaid reason, WAEC will conduct the exam and School Principals, supervisors, parents and the general public should please take note and make adequate arrangements for their candidates to sit the exam,” the statement added.

A similar statement signed by the Ikeja Zonal Coordinator of the examination body, T O Danjuma, was also shared with schools within the zone.
But the office of the Head of Nigeria’s Office of WAEC, Amos Dangut, has said the memo shared with the stakeholders was not for public consumption.
The spokesperson for the examination, Motorola Adesina, in a telephone interview with PREMIUM TIMES, also denied the claim that WAEC had dared the labour unions, even as she appealed for understanding.
She said the examination is being conducted across four member states of WAEC and that the timetable and schedules are the same across the countries.
Mrs Adesina said: “WAEC can never dictate to the Nigerian labour unions, but this is a passionate appeal for understanding for the sake of the future of the affected Nigerian children.”
Strike
The Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) and the Trade Union Congress of Nigeria (TUC) on Saturday directed its affiliates to mobilise for a total indefinite strike from Monday, 3 June.
The industrial action is expected to disrupt activities in schools, hospitals, and airports, which may lead to power outages, fuel scarcity, and transportation disruptions across the country.
The strike is to force the government to agree on a new minimum wage for workers as well as review the increase in the price of electricity for some consumers.
The labour unions are currently at loggerheads with the Nigerian government over negotiations for a new minimum wage. The current N30,000 minimum wage took effect in 2019, and the union is now negotiating a higher minimum wage with the government.
The NLC initially requested N600,000 but has now settled N494,000. However, the government rejected the amount, saying it is unsustainable and warning it could destabilise the economy and negatively impact over 200 million Nigerians. The government said it is offering N60,000, an amount the labour leaders reject, leading to a deadlock and a declaration of strike by the labour unions.

"‘We’ll come down heavily on attackers,’ Tinubu speaks on killing of soldiers in Abia",https://www.premiumtimesng.com/regional/ssouth-east/700359-well-come-down-heavily-on-attackers-tinubu-speaks-on-killing-of-soldiers-in-abia.html,PremiumTimes,"President Bola Tinubu has vowed that his administration would “come down heavily” on those responsible for the killing of soldiers in Abia State, south-east Nigeria.
Mr Tinubu disclosed this in a statement which he signed on Saturday.
The killing
PREMIUM TIMES reported how masked gunmen, on Thursday morning, attacked and killed five soldiers in Obikabia Junction in Aba, the commercial hub of the state.
The gunmen, who also burnt the soldiers’ patrol truck, were said to be enforcing the sit-at-home order declared by the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) across the South-east to mark their Biafra Day, which is celebrated annually in the region.

The Nigerian military would later vow to retaliate against the killing of the soldiers by the suspected IPOB members.

IPOB is a group seeking to carve out a sovereign state of Biafra from the South-east and some parts of the South-south of Nigeria.
‘We will come down heavily on the attackers.’
In the statement, which he also posted on his X handle, Mr Tinubu noted that the latest attack occurred months after a similar incident happened in Okuama Community in Delta State.
This newspaper reported how 17 soldiers on a peacekeeping mission were ambushed and killed by suspected residents of the Okuama Community in March.
The president said the attacks on Nigerian security forces were “unwarranted, barbaric, evil and condemnable”, adding that the situation would not be condoned or tolerated in the country.
“The federal government will come down heavily against those who have made it a habit to attack the officers and men of our armed forces needlessly,” Mr Tinubu said.
“They (security forces) surely do not deserve the mindless attacks by unruly elements in our society.
“On no account should anyone, under any guise, have the audacity to kill agents of state,” he stated.
‘Calling for sit-at-home treasonable’
Mr Tinubu ordered security agencies to track down killers of the soldiers and to also fish out those ordering sit-at-home in the South-east.
“Their actions are nothing short of treason,” he said of people issuing the illegal orders.
The president said the fact that the Nigerian security forces were exercising “necessary restraints” when attacked should not be mistaken for weakness.
“I want to make it clear that the government of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and the armed forces have the capacity to crush violent non-state actors, making our communities unsafe,” he said.
“We are working to build a peaceful and harmonious society, but nobody should be under any illusion that the government will not act appropriately when the lives of our officers and men are wantonly taken.”
Mr Tinubu commiserated with the families of the slain soldiers as well as the leadership of the Nigerian army over the incident.
“I urge other men and women on peacekeeping duty not to be discouraged by the unfortunate incident in Aba,” he said.

2024 UTME: JAMB to conduct supplementary examinations,https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/top-news/700336-2024-utme-jamb-to-conduct-supplementary-examinations.html,PremiumTimes,"The Joint Admissions and Matriculations Board (JAMB) said on Sunday that it is conducting a supplementary examination for the 2024 Unified Tertiary Matriculations Examination (UTME).
The board has also scheduled the supplementary examinations for 22 June, according to a statement by its spokesperson, Fabian Benjamin.
JAMB said 24,535 candidates are to take part in the supplementary examinations.
The examination board has also released an additional 3,921 withheld results.

Supplementary UTME
Candidates affected by the supplementary UTME include 3,633 prospective candidates of the Kwara State College of Arabic and Islamic Legal Studies (CAILS) who did not participate in the 2024 UTME based on the assumption that they would be accommodated in the 2024 DE exercise.
JAMB said the candidates can register for the UTME at any approved CBT centres in Kwara, Oyo or Osun states before Monday, 10 June.
“Having held high-stake meetings with the principal officers of the Kwara State College of Arabic and Islamic Legal Studies (CAILS) and the Kwara State University (KWASU), on the CAILS-KWASU Diploma programme, the Board has agreed to conduct a special registration exercise for the 3,633 prospective candidates, who did not participate in the 2024 UTME based on the assumption that they would be accommodated in the 2024 DE exercise,” the statement said.
Other candidates who are to take part in the supplementary UTME are 20,550 of the candidates whose results are still under investigation and yet to be released.
Also, 2,702 candidates whose fingers could not be verified during the 2024 UTME in April would sit the supplementary UTME.
“The remaining 322 candidates have been migrated to the category of candidates under examination misconduct as a prima-facie case has clearly been established that those who had registered were not those who appeared for the examination. Consequently, the number of examination misconduct has increased by 322 to 431,” the board said.
The rescheduled candidates are to print their supplementary examination notification slip from Tuesday, 4 June to ascertain their designated examination centres, JAMB added.
Releases more results
Meanwhile the examination body said it has released results of 3,921 candidates which were initially withheld after they were cleared of any wrongdoing. The latest development brings the total UTME results released to 1,883,350.
“Therefore, concerned candidates are urged to check their results from Saturday, 1st June 2024 by sending RESULT to 55019 or 66019 to ascertain their status as those cleared would have their results while those rescheduled would be told that they had been rescheduled,” JAMB added.
Backstory
When JAMB released the results of the 2024 UTME on 29 April, the board’s Registrar, Ishaq Oloyede, said 64,000 results have been withheld pending investigations of possible infractions by the candidates or their examination centres.
Mr Oloyede, a professor of Islamic Studies, explained at the time that 78 of the withheld results are under investigation for alleged examination misconduct, 4,594 for “procedural investigation of candidates, 2,896 “under investigation on verification,” and 57,056 for centre-based investigations.
He said over 70 per cent of candidates who sat the examination scored below 200 from the maximum of 400 obtainable scores. He added less than 1 per cent scored above 300

"Strike: Don’t disrupt hajj operations, NAHCON appeals to NLC, TUC",https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/top-news/700583-strike-dont-disrupt-hajj-operations-nahcon-appeals-to-nlc-tuc.html,PremiumTimes,"A member of the board of the National Hajj Commission of Nigeria (NAHCON), Sa’idu Dumbulwa, has appealed to the labour unions not to disrupt the airlift of pilgrims to Saudi Arabia as a result of the ongoing strike.
Mr Dumbulwa, who represents the Federal Ministry of Health on the board, stated this in a statement on Monday.
The Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) and the Trade Union Congress (TUC) commenced an indefinite strike on Monday to protest the refusal of the federal government to grant their demand for a minimum wage of N494,000. The government is proposing N60,000.
The unions in the aviation sector, on Sunday, directed their members to withdraw their services.

Only about 34,000 Nigerian pilgrims have been airlifted so far to Saudi Arabia for the 2024 hajj out of the over 60,000 expected to make the trip.

Mr Dumbulwa appealed to the NLC to exempt airport workers from the strike to ensure the smooth airlifting of pilgrims.
He acknowledged labour’s legitimate demands but emphasised the importance of considering the interests of Muslim members of the unions.
“Hajj is a once-in-a-lifetime ambition for many Muslims. I implore labour to avoid disrupting the airlift of pilgrims.
“In this context, I expect that exemptions should be made for airport workers in any strike actions at this critical time,” he said.

Nigerian govt decries vandalisation of 2nd Niger Bridge,https://www.premiumtimesng.com/regional/ssouth-east/700946-nigerian-govt-decries-vandalisation-of-2nd-niger-bridge.html,PremiumTimes,"Nigeria’s Minister of Works, Dave Umahi, has lamented the vandalisation of infrastructure on the Second Niger Bridge in Anambra State.
Mr Umahi described the vandalisation as “cruel,” according to a statement by his spokesperson, Uchenna Orji, on Monday.
The vandalisation
Earlier on Monday, a social media influencer, Anayo Usulor, popularly known as Lord Zues, uploaded a video clip showing the vandalised part of the Second Niger Bridge.
In the clip, some rail fittings installed on the bridge were uprooted and vandalised by unknown persons.

Mr Usulor called on authorities to investigate the development. He expressed fears that the destruction could cause an accident along the bridge.

In another clip, the social media influencer was seen at the bridge in the company of armed police operatives.
He explained that he reported the matter to the divisional police officer of C-Division Headquarters in Asaba, Delta State, who subsequently deployed the operatives to bring the uprooted rail fittings to their facility for safekeeping.
Umahi speaks
Reacting to the incident, Mr Umahi condemned the vandalisation of the bridge, saying the incident amounted to a sabotage of key national infrastructure.
“It is heartrending that the facilities are being vandalised by those who are meant to own the benefits it serves,” he said.
The minister assured Nigerians that “a more formidable security architecture” was being activated to forestall further havoc on the bridge.
He said a technical team has been directed to inspect, evaluate and reinstate the damaged parts of the bridge.
Mr Umahi appealed to residents of the area and motorists to assist the ministry by keeping watch over the bridge and reporting vandals to security agencies.
“The Federal Ministry of Works shall promptly and handsomely reward any person or group who nabs or gives useful information on the identity of perpetrators of vandalisation of facilities on the 2nd Niger Bridge or any of our road infrastructure facilities nationwide,” he said.
The minister vowed that the federal government will prosecute anyone caught vandalising the second Niger Bridge and other infrastructure across the country.
The Second Niger Bridge
The Second Niger Bridge was commissioned on 23 May 2023 by former President Muhammadu Buhari.
The construction of the new bridge began on 1st September 2018.
The bridge traverses Asaba in Delta State, South-south Nigeria, to Ozubulu, Ogbaru and other communities in Anambra State, South-east Nigeria.
The first Niger Bridge, linking Onitsha and Asaba, was completed in 1965 and built by the French construction company Dumez.

LG Autonomy: Lawmaker commends FG on litigation against governors,https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/more-news/698366-lg-autonomy-lawmaker-commends-fg-on-litigation-against-governors.html,PremiumTimes,"The Senator representing Kano South Senatorial District, Kawu Sumaila, has commended the federal government for instituting litigation against the 36 state governments for undermining local governance.
Mr Sumaila, a member of the New Nigeria People’s Party (NNPP) gave the commendation in a statement on Monday in Abuja.
The office of the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice recently filed a suit at the Supreme Court against the state governments, seeking the enforcement of full autonomy of the local governments in Nigeria.
In the suit marked: SC/CV/343/2024, the federal government urged the court to issue an order prohibiting state governors from embarking on unilateral, arbitrary and unlawful dissolution of democratically elected local government leaders.

Reacting to the litigation, Mr Sumaila said the development will help reinstate the autonomy of local governance and also facilitate the development of the economy through the grassroots.

The Kano senator said that the LG autonomy will improve the revenue generation of the country.
“I am happy, Mr. President has begun to tow on our path to salvage our people by giving the local governments autonomy to operate as enshrined in the constitution.
“The decision to compel the 36 states of the federation to give autonomy to local governments is a step in the right direction. This will surely help in bringing development to our people, particularly the grassroots in the rural areas.
“It will equally boost the nation’s economy by increasing our Internally Generated Revenue through the agricultural value chain and other commercial activities that will come up after the local governments get their autonomy,” he said.
Mr Sumaila also urged the federal government to adopt a policy that will prevent state governors and other politicians from intruding in local government elections.
“I would be glad if President Tinubu would also address challenges affecting the conduct of local government elections in the nation.
“The president should do something to stop politicians from messing up with the processes of local government elections for their personal interests. We are all aware of how local government elections are conducted under the watch of state governors in this country.
“From the primary to the mainstream election, the processes are always being manipulated by politicians for their personal interest against the interests of the majority”, he added.
There are 774 local government areas in the country. The local government system has been crippled due to the influence and interest of the state governors.
Funds meant for local governments in the Federation Account are paid monthly to them through their respective state governments.
The Deputy Senate President, Barau Jibrin, recently alleged that some state governors are used to diverting local government allocation to personal use.
The Senate had also asked President Bola Tinubu to convene a national dialogue to deliberate on full autonomy for local governments in the country.
It said the dialogue should involve the governors, state legislators, local government officials, civil society organisations, community leaders and others.

"Kenyan e-commerce startup Copia Global lays off 1,060 employees",https://techcabal.com/2024/06/06/copia-layoffs-kenya/, ,"Copia layoffs will raise questions about the company’s future two weeks after it entered into administration.
Two weeks after an internal memo showed that the B2C e-commerce platform was struggling to make payroll, Copia Global has laid off at least 1,060 employees, suggesting the company may be on the brink of a shutdown or massively scaling back operations. 
In a 20-minute meeting with staff on Thursday, Copia CEO Tim Steel and administrators appointed last week to take over the company asked employees to return company property, including laptops and tablets, and sign their termination letters on Friday, June 7th.
CEO Tim Steel declined to comment but promised to share new information on Friday. 
Although Copia has agreed to pay a one-month salary and other benefits like accrued unpaid leave days by Kenyan labour laws, administrators have not yet specified a timeframe for these payments. 
This lack of clarity has caused concern among employees, considering the recent delay in May salaries, which were only paid this week. Two employees told TechCabal they would not sign their termination letters until Copia clarifies the payment schedule for their compensation and benefits.
An ex-employee claimed Copia started facing business difficulties in 2022. The financial constraints forced the company to scale back operations, including exiting Uganda barely two years after launching and laying off 700 employees. 
On Tuesday, Copia stopped taking orders from six key locations in Kenya, including Embu and Eldoret, likely to cut its already squeezed expenditure. It had asked employees working in the affected markets to take leave. At its peak, Copia had a 50,000-agent network serving rural Kenya. 
On May 16, in a leaked internal memo, Copia warned employees that the company could either fold up or restructure its business by laying off 1060 employees

Nigerian fintech startups could spend over $1 million on KYC address verification,https://techcabal.com/2024/06/06/nigeria-fintech-could-pay-1million-to-verify-addresses/,Techcabal,"Following important changes to Know Your Customer processes by the Central Bank, fintech startups must now physically verify the addresses of POS agents (if they offer agency banking services) and all other customers. While the startups will not grumble over the requirements—it was a condition for lifting a six-week freeze on new customer onboarding—several executives spoke about how expensive the process will be. 
To physically verify POS agents, for instance, these startups could pay up to ₦1000 ($0.40) for each agent verified. Those costs could balloon quickly for prominent startups that boast hundreds of thousands of agents. 
Per publicly available figures for its number of registered agents, OPay could pay at least ₦563 million ($376,000), while PalmPay’s bill could be in the region of ₦500 million ($333,883), and Moniepoint would have to fork out ₦304 million ($196,000).
It could cost the fintech industry ₦1.5 billion ($1 million) to verify 1.5 million POS agents. Those figures could eventually be higher considering that several fintech executives declined to specify the amounts they pay the verifiers. Additionally, as many PoS agents work for several fintech startups, there’s also the possibility that the total bill could be a lot lower. 
Whatever the final bill is, it will not include the cost of verifying retail customers which would eclipse the cost for POS agents as self-reported numbers for these fintechs exceed ten million. 
Fintechs like Moniepoint, Opay, and Palmpay, with an extensive network of agents, could use agent managers to verify the addresses of retail customers. While this approach might be cost-effective as the managers—scattered all over Nigeria—are already on these fintech books, they would still need to be paid extra. 
Physical address verification for agents and retail customers is an important part of increasing transparency and reducing the lack of visibility that bad actors exploit. POS fraud contributed 8.8% to the total amount lost to fraud in the fourth quarter of 2023, according to the Financial Institutions Training Centre (FITC), a financial research and advocacy organisation operated by the Central Bank of Nigeria. 
For fintechs like Kuda and Paga that do not run extensive cash-in and cash-out operations, identity management startups will likely help with address verification. While it is difficult to verify the prices of these services due to confidentiality, it would still represent a significant burden for these fintechs.  
On April 29, Nigeria’s Central Bank ordered a freeze on new customer onboarding after concerns that lax KYC was giving bad actors joy. Physical address verification will also help authorities have more visibility over peer-to-peer crypto transactions, which it argues is a key component of currency manipulation. 
The regulators will point to NIBSS’ Q1 2024 fraud report which showed a decline in incidents and amounts lost, but it’s still early days. 
Beyond the monetary cost of address verification, Nigeria has also missed a six-week window to increase financial inclusion as these fintechs have become synonymous with introducing banking to areas with low bank and ATM penetration. According to an industry report, technology contributed heavily to an 8% jump in formal inclusion in three years.

In 2023, OPay claimed to start the year with 19 million accounts and according to a regulatory filing by Opera, an early OPay investor, the fintech quadrupled its user base (76 million). Based on that filing, fintech averaged 1.1 million new users weekly and the onboarding freeze would have cost the company at least 6 million new users. While OPay is the market leader, Moniepoint and Palmpay follow closely and are growing rapidly, according to an industry expert who asked not to be named.

Ethiopia’s inflation jumps to 28.7% as central bank acknowledges alleviation difficulties,https://techcabal.com/2024/02/12/ethiopias-inflation-jumps-to-28-percent/,Techcabal,"Inflation in Ethiopia has hit 28.7% with the National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE) acknowledging that it has been one of the country’s most challenging macroeconomic issues for many years. Based on its monetary policy statement, the country, home to nearly 120 million people, has struggled to tackle rising inflation, with an average inflation of 16% per year recorded over the last ten years.
“Inflation outturns over the past two years have risen even beyond this average historical rate and persisted for much longer than initially expected,” read a statement from the NBE. [ad]
According to data from the NBE, Ethiopia recorded consecutive months of inflation below 30%. In December 2023, the annual inflation rate increased to 28.7% from 28.3% in November 2023. Food prices, which comprise over half (53.5%) of the consumer price index (CPI) grew to 30.6% compared to the same period in 2022, and slightly higher than the 30% recorded in November 2023.
The jump was linked to the nation’s internal conflict, the Tigray war.  
An overlap in malnutrition, disease, and food insecurity has worsened the situation. About 4 million people have also been affected by the ongoing drought. “Some supply-side and cost-push factors found to be statistically significant in contributing to inflation have included the internal conflict that disrupted local food transport/distribution networks and the large jump in key global commodity prices,” said the NBE. 
Other items besides food increased to 26.1% in December 2023 from 26.0% in the prior month, influenced by a weaker currency, the Ethiopian birr. Nonetheless, the NBE wants to reduce inflation to under 20% by June 2024 and under 10% by June 2025. They plan to do this by managing how much money is lent and cutting back on giving money directly to the government. [ad]
Performance of the Ethiopian birr
In December 2023, the birr lost value by 4.8%, ending the year at 56.1 birr for $1 from 53.6 birr recorded in December 2022, per a statement shared by Safaricom Ethiopia. The government made some changes in September 2022 to bring more foreign currency into the country. For instance, the NBE halted foreign currency use for purchasing in the country. Ethiopians can only keep foreign currencies for 30 days, instead of 90 when they return to the country from foreign trips. At the same time, the NBE made it easier for people to bring foreign currency into the country.
Ethiopians can bring up to $4,000 without declaring the cash at customs. However, the amount of money non-citizens can bring in without alerting customs officials has more than tripled from $3,000 to $10,000.

Nigeria’s Central Bank delivers modest 150 basis point interest rate increase,https://techcabal.com/2024/05/21/cbn-delivers-26-25-interes-rates-increase/,Techcabal,"Members of the Monetary Policy Committee voted to raise interest rates by 150 basis points to 26.25% from 24.75%, a moderate increase following more aggressive rate hikes in February and March. The vote for a moderate increase is unsurprising as the general thinking is that more time is needed for the previous rate hikes to have an effect. 
At least four policy experts surveyed by TechCabal predicted a 100 basis point hike. 
“The key focus of the MPC at this meeting remained to achieve price stability to rein inflation. Members observed that while year-on-year inflation rose moderately, the month-on-month measures of food and core declined significantly,” said Olayemi Cardoso, the Central Bank chief. “The tight monetary stance of the bank is yielding outcomes.” 
Nigeria’s inflation rate has continued to accelerate despite those rate hikes; in April, headline inflation rose to 33.69% with food inflation reaching unprecedented levels. This week’s Monetary Policy Meeting was a test of the bank’s resolve to keep raising rates until inflation moderates. 
“The persistent weakness of the Naira will continue to drive higher inflation, necessitating even higher interest rates and leaving a precarious outlook for non-oil sector growth,” a note from Agora Policy, an Abuja-based policy research firm said.
“We need to take some tough decisions on the fiscal side, you can’t hike your way out of this mess,” Prof. Joseph Nnanna, Chief Economist at the Development Bank of Nigeria said. 
In the FX market, price stability is a continuing issue. Despite being the best-performing currency in April 2024, the naira has lost all of those gains. An outsized focus on “unathorised FX” trading has led to a raft of policies, but FX volatility remains.

"Exclusive: One month after ban on onboarding new customers, fintechs and regulators talks continue",https://techcabal.com/2024/05/20/fintechs-given-list-of-conditions-for-new-account-onboarding/,Techcabal,"One month after a ban on onboarding new customers, fintechs are still at the negotiating table with regulators.
Five Nigerian neobanks—Moniepoint, OPay, Palmpay, Kuda, and Paga—remain unable to onboard new customers one month after a TechCabal report revealed the restriction was connected to a directive from the National Security Adviser (NSA). The leaders of those neobanks met with the NSA, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), and the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) in Abuja on Friday, April 26, two people familiar with the talks said.
In those talks and continuing engagements, the fintechs were given conditions before new account openings could resume.
If those talks stall, it will slow growth for the venture-funded neobanks that have benefited from an explosion in digital payments. It also highlights the weak lobbying power of fintech as they continue to face scrutiny over Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures and fraud prevention.
According to one person familiar with the talks, the neobanks have been asked to restrict peer-to-peer crypto transactions. It aligns with a plan by authorities to ban P2P crypto trading, first reported by TechCabal after the NSA classified crypto trading a “national security issue.” 
One neobank executive said banning P2P transactions was “impossible” because there’s no way to know if a transaction is crypto-related. Since Nigeria’s initial ban on crypto, traders quickly learned to avoid adding descriptions or comments in transactions. 
Despite the complex nature of the request, the neobanks have sent notifications to customers warning that P2P transactions will be blocked and reported to authorities. 
The neobanks have also been asked to update customer details and mandate bank verification numbers or national identity numbers for all tiered accounts in line with a December 2023 directive. That directive mandates valid identification for all types of accounts, strengthening KYC processes that were initially relaxed to boost financial inclusion.
Last week, Palmpay asked customers to complete facial recognition verification before May 31st or face account restrictions while Kuda asked customers to upload proof of their house addresses before the same deadline. Other affected neobanks will also ask customers to update their details in the coming weeks, an executive at a neobank told TechCabal. 
These conditions will compel the fintechs to enhance their KYC processes and ensure they comply with the CBN’s new KYC rules, one person with knowledge of the talks said. The conditions will also change what regulators perceive to be a crypto-friendly attitude on the part of the fintechs.
The government’s hard stance on crypto trading began in February 2024 after it arrested two Binance executives. In April, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission blocked 1,146 bank accounts involved in “unauthorised forex dealings.” 
The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) also held a meeting in May asking crypto exchanges to delist the p2p feature. Kucoin, a popular crypto exchange paused its p2p trading last week.
The fintechs and crypto players have no leverage in these talks, one former CBN insider shared. Attempts to band together and lobby the government have led nowhere, with one fintech executive claiming that the initial plan to present a united front to the regulators was ignored by industry players.
In 2023, a plan to convene fintech players to fight fraud similarly led nowhere, highlighting how intense rivalry may complicate cooperation. Traditional banks on the other hand, routinely cooperate and wield some influence with the regulators.
For the affected fintechs, the lifting of the ban cannot come soon enough.

"Nigeria raises levy on e-transfers by 900%, analysts call for a transaction cap",https://techcabal.com/2024/05/07/nigeria-cybersecurity-levy/,Techcabal,"Nigeria’s Central Bank will begin the implementation of an amended 2015 Cybersecurity Act that will levy a 0.5% fee on all electronic transactions on May 20, an increase of 900% from an earlier levy of 0.005%. It means an electronic transfer of ₦1,000 will attract a ₦5 fee while a ₦100,000 transfer will attract a ₦500 fee.
The cybersecurity levy will be charged in addition to existing fees like stamp duty, a ₦50 charge on electronic receipt or transfer of money in any deposit money bank or financial institution on sums of ₦10,000 or more.
When the levy goes into effect in two weeks, it will have only a few exceptions: money transfers within the same bank, salary payments, school fees payments, and loan repayments. 
Financial industry experts argue the new levy will constitute a burden for low-income earners who rely on electronic transactions for daily activities. The value of electronic transactions in Nigeria rose by 66% to over ₦600 trillion in 2023, according to the Nigeria Inter-Bank Settlement System (NIBSS).
The Cybersecurity Act was first passed in 2015 and introduced a 0.005% levy on electronic transfers. 
A June 2018 CBN memo directed banks to collect the levy on “electronic transactions occurring in a bank or on a mobile money scheme or any other payment platform that have an accompanying service charge.” 
In 2024, the Act was amended and the levy was increased by 900% to 0.05% and it was extended the levy to cover fintechs, payment service providers, and other financial institutions.
“It’s a little bit regressive. What we should be advocating for is an amendment to the law. There should be a cap on the transactions,” said a financial industry expert who asked not to be named so he could speak freely. 
On May 3, the National Security Adviser, Nuhu Ribadu called for an implementation of the amended act, highlighting the increased influence of the NSA. The cybersecurity levy will be remitted monthly to the National Cybersecurity Fund (NCF), managed by the NSA.
Last week, the NSA ordered five fintechs to stop onboarding new customers and deemed crypto a national security issue.

Breaking: Lesaka to acquire fintech platform Adumo for $85 million,https://techcabal.com/2024/05/08/lesaka-adumo-acquisition/,Techcabal,"Lesaka Technologies, the NASDAQ-listed fintech company with a market capitalisation of R4.5 billion ($242 million), is acquiring payment platform Adumo for R1.59 billion ($85 million) in cash and equity. The deal is scheduled to be completed in the third quarter of 2024 and will extend Lesaka’s payment footprint in the southern African region to five countries. 
Founded in 2019, Cape Town-based Adumo provides card-acquiring POS devices, integrated payments and reconciliations services to merchants and consumers. The company claims to process over R24 billion ($1.3 billion) annually and has 23,000 merchants and 240,000 consumers using its services respectively.
Lesaka currently owns EasyPay, South Africa’s largest payment switch not owned by a bank and Kazang, a widely popular card-acquiring POS device company. A combination of the services will enable the company to grab a significant market share in the southern African region, where competing startups like YOCO are still only based in South Africa.
In February, Lesaka acquired Touchsides, a data analytics and merchant services company with over 10,000 point-of-sale terminals across South Africa, for an undisclosed amount. Touchsides was previously owned by international beverage giant Heineken.
According to Lesaka, the acquisition will give the company a footprint of 1.7 million active consumers and 119, 000 merchants across South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, Zambia, and Kenya. “The acquisition reinforces Lesaka’s position as a natural consolidator of Southern African Fintech and will enhance our strengths in both the consumer and merchant markets,” the company said in a statement.

Exclusive: Kenyan officials deny arrest of Binance exec who escaped custody in Nigeria,https://techcabal.com/2024/04/24/exclusive-kenyan-officials-deny-arrest-of-binance-anjarwalla/,Techcabal,"Kenyan officials have denied reports that Nadeem Anjarwalla, the Binance executive facing tax evasion charges in Nigeria, was arrested in Kenya on April 22. Several Nigerian publications claimed Anjarwalla, who escaped from an Abuja hotel where he was being held on March 25, would be extradited within the week.
Nigerian authorities asked the Kenyan government to arrest and extradite Anjarwalla three weeks ago, people familiar with the matter said. So far, Nairobi has only confirmed his presence in the country, slowing down the West African nation’s case against crypto giant Binance.
According to Kenyan law, an extradition request sent to the Attorney General can only be executed through the Directorate of Public Prosecution (DPP) after receiving an arrest warrant from a magistrate court.  
Top Kenyan officials, including Resila Onyango, the spokesperson for the National Police Service (NPS) told TechCabal on Tuesday they were unaware of the arrest. Two other officials who asked not to be named called reports that first appeared in Nigeria’s The Punch rumours.
Crypto publication Coindesk also reported on Monday that Anjarwalla’s wife denied news of the extradition.
A high-ranking detective at Kenya’s Directorate of Criminal Investigation (DCI), with direct knowledge of Nigeria’s extradition request through Interpol, also claimed no arrest had been made as alleged.
“They are piling pressure, but he has not been arrested as reported. The process is lengthy and cannot be done without involving other agencies. Interpol cannot arrest a Kenyan without following the law,” the investigator told TechCabal.
According to international laws on extradition, while Interpol, the international police organisation, enables information sharing among law enforcement agencies in over 190 countries, it cannot execute arrest warrants.
The confusion around the whereabouts of Anjarwalla and extradition is similar to an incident involving Nigerian national Nnamdi Kanu, who was arrested in Nairobi in 2021 and sent to Nigeria to face terrorism charges. Kenyan officials denied any involvement in the extraordinary rendition.
However, Anjarwalla’s case is more complex because he holds a Kenyan passport, which he reportedly used after his escape from Nigeria. 
If arrested, the Binance boss can fight the extradition in court, which could take months or years.  
Nigeria’s Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) has accused Anjarwalla and another Binance executive, Tigran Gambaryan, of failing to register the crypto exchange with it for tax purposes.  
FIRS said in court filings that Binance failed to deduct Value Added Tax (VAT) and aided users in evading taxes through its platform. Binance and the executives have denied the claims. 
Gambrayan is still in custody and has pled not guilty to money laundering charges, Nadeem escaped from an Abuja guest house where he was held and escaped to Kenya before he was arraigned.

Patricia customers to receive first batch of repayments in November as company appoints trustee,https://techcabal.com/2023/10/24/patricia-repayment/,Techcabal,"Patricia has engaged the services of DLM Trust, an SEC-licensed trust company to handle the disbursement of repayments to customers.

DLM Trust, a trust company licensed by Nigeria’s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), will handle the disbursement of repayments to customers of Nigeria-focused crypto platform Patricia. It is Patricia’s latest move to repay $2 million in customers’ assets lost in a hack last year. DLM Trust confirmed the partnership in a statement published on Nairametrics on Tuesday. The company will serve as an escrow trustee—a third party that holds money or an asset on behalf of the other two parties in a transaction.

Per the DLM statement, the first batch of repayments to Patricia customers will be disbursed starting November 20, 2023. Kehinde Lawal, senior associate at DLM Trust, told TechCabal that the company has received some funds from Patricia to issue refunds to customers. In September, TechCabal reported that the Lithuania-based company had raised some funds to repay customers, though its CEO, Hanu Fejiro didn’t provide further details of the investment. 

“The funds are coming from Patricia and its partners/investors. We are acting as a trustee [and] making sure that we pay the customers as at when due. Payment plan and disbursement strategies will be made available to the users in the coming days,” Lawal said.

However, this repayment plan is tricky because DLM Trust doesn’t handle digital assets and its regulator—the SEC—has a firm stance against cryptocurrency. In May, Bloomberg reported that the SEC was considering allowing tokenized coin offerings on licensed digital exchanges that are backed by assets including equity, debt, and property with the exemption of crypto.

Last week, Fejiro confirmed to TechCabal that Patricia is asking users to convert their debt tokens to company shares which will be managed by an SEC-licensed company. Lawal disclosed that the plan is still in the works. “There have been discussions around converting debt to equity. It’s subject to the users’ discretion. And it is a part of the overall debt management strategy. That is in motion,” he said."
Kenya’s $20 billion crypto market takes first step to regulation,https://techcabal.com/2023/11/07/blockchain-association-of-kenya-to-draft-crypto-laws/,Techcabal,"The crypto market in Kenya is huge and is already being taxed under the provisions of the Finance Act, 2023. 

Kenya’s parliament has asked the Blockchain Association of Kenya (BAK) to prepare the first draft of what might become the Virtual Asset Service Provider’s Bill, commonly known as the Crypto Bill. The decision followed BAK’s second appearance before the National Assembly Committee on Finance and National Planning on October 31. BAK’s first engagement with the committee was in August 2023 when it opposed the Digital Asset Tax (DAT) provision in Kenya’s Finance Act, 2023. BAK’s draft preparation coincides with notable cryptocurrency transactions in Kenya, reaching nearly $20 billion (KES 3 trillion) between July 2021 and June 2022. Kenya’s engagement with crypto assets is also high, coming in third position in Africa for crypto site traffic and 21st in global crypto adoption.

The meeting between BAK and the National Assembly Committee sought to enable BAK to partner with the national government in shaping cryptocurrency and digital asset regulation policies. BAK, alongside Binance, Yellow Card, Kotani Pay, and the Law Society of Kenya (LSK), presented key elements for a robust regulatory framework, including a clear licencing framework, tax framework, consumer protection framework, anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorism financing measures, and a regulatory sandbox.

In response, the parliamentary committee directed BAK to draft and submit a bill governing digital assets within two months. This development acknowledges a knowledge gap that has historically hindered their ability to address this asset class. It also marks a unique instance of a parliamentary committee instructing an association to draft a bill for adoption.

BAK’s directive to draft Kenya’s digital asset regulatory framework, including tax integration and revenue guidelines, mirrors efforts in South Africa (Financial Sector Conduct Authority), Nigeria (Finance Act 2023, SEC Regulations on Digital Assets), and Mauritius (Virtual Asset and Initial Token Offering Services Act 2021), which lead in Africa’s crypto market values at $25 billion, $19 billion, and $3 billion, respectively.

Multichoice incurs $190.5 million forex loss from Nigerian operation in 2024 ,https://nairametrics.com/2024/06/07/multichoice-incurs-190-5-million-forex-loss-from-nigerian-operation-in-2024/,Nairametrics,"Pan-African Pay-tv operator, Multichoice, has notified its shareholders of grim full-year results citing tough macroeconomic conditions and a $190.5 million (R3.6 billion) foreign exchange loss from Multichoice Nigeria.  
The Group disclosed this in a trading statement published on Thursday.
The company’s financial result for the year ended March 31, 2024, is expected to be published on 12 June. 
Multichoice, which is in the middle of an acquisition by France’s Groupe Canal+, said it anticipates a trading profit decline of between 19% and 23% compared to the 2023 financial year, while the headline loss per share number will more than double. 
The release of the trading statement is in compliance with the Johannesburg Stock Exchange rules that require companies to provide a trading statement as soon as they are satisfied the current reporting period will differ by at least 20% from the financial results of the previous corresponding period. 
Expected losses 
While disclosing that the group’s expected loss per share has also been impacted by a once-off impairment of IT systems of R1 billion, Multichoice said, 
“The group expects losses and headline losses per share to increase due to the negative impact of a weak macroeconomic and consumer environment, increased investment in Showmax, and the impact of the sharp depreciation in the Nigerian naira against the US dollar. This resulted in foreign exchange losses on the non-quasi intergroup loans with MultiChoice Nigeria of R3.6-billion (net of tax and non-controlling interest).” 
“The group’s expected loss per share has also been impacted by a once-off impairment of IT systems of R1-billion (net of tax and non-controlling interest), due to a reassessment of business needs in the context of an extremely challenging operating environment,” it added.  
An additional trading loss year over year of R1.4-billion is expected at Showmax according to the company.  
However, despite the adverse conditions and an additional R1.4 billion year-on-year increase in Showmax trading losses, the group projects an increase in organic trading profit due to inflation-led pricing and successful cost optimisation across most of its markets.

Citing economic challenges, Multichoice Nigeria had In April increased the prices of DStv and GOtv packages by at least 25%.  This marks the third increment since last year, following the initial adjustment implemented on May 1, 2023. 
Ahead of the implementation of the new prices on May 1, a Competition and Consumer Protection Tribunal (CCPT) sitting in Abuja issued an order restraining from implementing the new prices based on a case filed by a Nigerian customer of the company. 
However, Multichoice ignored the court order and implemented the new prices. This prompted the Tribunal to slam a fine of N150 million on Multichoice for challenging the jurisdiction of the court. 
The verdict delivered by three of the panel led by Thomas Okosu on Friday also ordered Multichoice to give Nigerians a one-month free subscription on DSTV and GOTV. Multichoice has yet to respond to the verdict as of the time of filing this report.

Nigeria’s domestic cargo sector took N7 billion hit during 2-day strike – Association ,https://nairametrics.com/2024/06/07/nigerias-domestic-cargo-sector-took-n7-billion-hit-during-2-day-strike-association/,Nairametrics,"Domestic cargo agents in Nigeria estimate that the country lost about N7 billion during the two-day nationwide strike by the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) and Trade Union Congress (TUC).  
The strike, which began on Monday and was suspended on Tuesday, resulted in the halting of airline operations across the country. 
This information was disclosed by the Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the Domestic Airports Cargo Agents Association (DACAA), Mr. Ikpe Nkanang, during an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lagos on Friday. 
Nkanang stated that with approximately 30 tonnes of cargo lifted across the country’s domestic airports daily, the volume of cargo left unprocessed during the two-day strike was significant, resulting in a loss of about N7 billion.  
“For those two days, the airlines were not working,  and once the airlines are not working, cargo cannot move, and it is a great loss to all of us. 
“You needed to see the volume of cargo that was dumped over those two days; of course, you know we gathered cargoes during the weekend hoping that by Monday and Tuesday, we would be able to send them out. 
“It was a colossal loss to us in the cargo world, it affected our income and, of course, the economy of the country. 
“For those few hours of the strike, the country lost about N7 billion across all local airports,” he said. 
Backstory 
The Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) and the Trade Union Congress (TUC) embarked on a nationwide strike on Monday, June 3rd, 2024, due to the tripartite committee’s failure to agree on a new minimum wage for workers.  
Additionally, the unions protested against the hike in electricity tariffs, arguing that it placed an undue burden on workers and consumers across the country. 
When the strike commenced on Monday, workers closed down ministries, departments, and agencies of the federal, state, and local governments, as well as public facilities such as airports and seaports, in compliance with the strike. 
In the aviation sector, domestic commercial airlines were unable to provide any services, including passenger and cargo operations, as airports were shut down from Monday until Tuesday.  
This nationwide halt in aviation operations affected travellers within Nigeria, those needing connecting flights for international travel, and businessmen, entrepreneurs, and individuals sending cargo via domestic airlines. 
The nationwide shutdown on Monday, including a nationwide electricity blackout due to the strike, prompted the federal government to meet with NLC and TUC representatives on Monday evening.  
This meeting led to the unions suspending the strike for five days on Tuesday. The suspension was based on the resolution from President Bola Ahmed Tinubu’s administration to establish a new minimum wage exceeding N60,000.

Reps to probe MDAs for over $2 billion renewable energy investments in Nigeria,https://nairametrics.com/2024/06/07/reps-to-probe-mdas-for-over-2-billion-renewable-energy-investments-in-nigeria/#google_vignette,Nairametrics,"The House of Representatives has mandated its Committee on Renewable Energy to investigate various Ministries, Departments, and Agencies (MDAs) involved in the investment, procurement, and receipt of grants aimed at developing the renewable energy sector in Nigeria. 
This investigation, covering the period from 2015, is to be completed within four weeks, with a report submitted to the House for further legislative action. 
The decision was made following the adoption of a resolution titled ‘Need to Investigate Investments in Renewable Energy Sector and Foreign Grants received from 2015 till date,’ sponsored by Jesse Okey Joe Onuakalusi, the lawmaker representing Oshodi-Isolo II Federal Constituency, Lagos State. 
A document containing the resolutions made on Thursday noted that the lawmakers “mandate the Committee on Renewable Energy to investigate Ministries, Departments, and Agencies (MDAs) of the government associated with the investment, procurement, and receipt of grants meant to develop the renewable energy sector from 2015 till date and report within four (4) weeks for further legislative action.” 
Key Points from the House Resolutions 
The House noted the essential role of electricity in the economic and social development of every nation. It also acknowledged the significant challenges posed by poor electricity generation and distribution to the country’s economic development and the living conditions of its people. 
According to the lawmakers, successive governments since 2015 have made substantial investments and attracted multimillion-dollar foreign grants to the renewable energy subsector of Nigeria’s power industry to create a viable and sustainable alternative energy supply. 
They noted that in December 2023, the World Bank approved a $750 million facility to boost renewable energy in Nigeria, with the goal of providing over 17.5 million Nigerians with improved access to electricity through distributed renewable energy solutions. 
They also noted that in 2020, the federal government launched a $200 million renewable energy project, tagged ‘Nigeria Electrification Project (NEP),’ aimed at providing off-grid energy to over 500,000 people across 105,000 households in rural communities, funded by the African Development Bank (AfDB). 
The lawmakers further argued that despite attracting over $2 billion in renewable energy investments in the past decade, as reported by the Rural Electrification Agency in 2023, there has been no noticeable improvement in the sector. 
The House of Reps was alarmed that the dysfunctional electricity generation and supply system persists, contrary to the objectives behind government investments and grants aimed at developing the renewable energy sector.

"Nigeria Governors’ Forum declares N60,000 minimum wage unsustainable and unfeasible ",https://nairametrics.com/2024/06/07/nigeria-governors-forum-declares-n60000-minimum-wage-unsustainable-and-unfeasible/,Nairametrics,"The Nigeria Governors’ Forum (NGF) has stated that while a new minimum wage is necessary, a minimum wage of N60,000 is unsustainable and unfeasible.  
This resolution was reached after a meeting of the 36 governors on Friday, where they deliberated on a suitable minimum wage that state governments can afford, in response to protests by the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) and the Trade Union Congress (TUC) demanding an increase above N60,000 to reflect the current economic realities in the country. 
This information was contained in an official statement posted on the X (formerly Twitter) account of Bayo Onanuga, the Special Adviser on Information and Strategy to President Bola Tinubu.  
“All things considered, the NGF holds that the N60,000 minimum wage proposal is not sustainable and can not fly.  
“It will simply mean that many states will spend all their FAAC allocations on just paying salaries with nothing left for development purposes. In fact, a few states will end up borrowing to pay workers every month. We do not think this will be in the collective interest of the country, including workers,” the statement read in part.  
According to the Governors’ Forum, raising the minimum wage to N60,000 has broader implications, including necessary adjustments for all employment cadres and pensioners.
The Forum emphasizes that any agreement reached should not be made hastily but should be sustainable and realistic. 
Additionally, the NGF urges all parties, especially labour unions, to consider all socioeconomic factors and strive for an agreement that is sustainable, durable, and fair to all segments of society with legitimate claims to public resources. 
What you should know 
The Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) and the Trade Union Congress (TUC) have repeatedly demanded an increase in the minimum wage from N30,000 over the past year.  
The labour unions proposed a minimum wage of N494,000, citing this amount as necessary for a worker’s survival given the current economic realities of the country.
However, the federal government stated that it could not sustain this demand, saying it was unsustainable and would result in a N9.5 trillion bill. 
The Minister of Information and National Orientation, Mohammed Idris, reiterated that the federal government cannot afford to pay the proposed minimum wage of N494,000, as it would be unsustainable. 
In response to the government’s stance, the trade unions embarked on a nationwide strike on Monday, June 3, 2024, demanding an increase in the minimum wage and a reduction in the recently increased electricity tariffs.  
The strike saw widespread compliance, bringing the country to a standstill with ministries, departments, and agencies of the government, as well as public facilities such as airports and seaports, shut down.  
Later that Monday evening, the federal government met with the labour unions, and a resolution was reached where the government agreed to a minimum wage of above N60,000.  
Consequently, the labour unions suspended the strike on Tuesday for five days, pending a final agreement between the trade unions and the government regarding the minimum wage.

"FG adds just N2000 to previous proposed N60,000 minimum wage as organized labour demand N250,000",https://nairametrics.com/2024/06/08/fg-adds-just-n2000-to-previous-proposed-n60000-minimum-wage-as-organized-labour-demand-n250000/,Nairametrics,"The federal government has raised its proposed national minimum wage to N62,000 from previously rejected N60,000, following extensive deliberations with the organized private sector.
This comes as organized labour adjusts its requested amount from N494,000 to N250,000 in the ongoing negotiations.
The agreement was reached after several hours of meetings on Friday, where both parties—the Federal Government and the organized private sector—decided to increase their initial offer from N60,000 to N62,000.
The new minimum wage
Despite this adjustment, organized labour’s proposal of N250,000 remains a substantial figure compared to the government’s offer.
The tripartite committee, constituted by the Federal Government in January, has concluded its deliberations, and the recommendations are now set to be forwarded to President Tinubu. He is expected to present an executive bill to the National Assembly for legislative action.
The current minimum wage of N30,000, established in 2019, has become untenable amidst the prevailing economic challenges.
Both the government and organized labour acknowledge the necessity of a new, more realistic minimum wage.
However, arriving at an agreeable figure has proven difficult. The organized labour’s initial demand of N494,000 was considered excessively high by both the government and the private sector, while labour found the government’s initial offer of N60,000 insufficient.
What you should know
Tensions escalated as labour unions, unsatisfied with the progress, issued an ultimatum on May 31, and subsequently embarked on a nationwide strike on June 3.
This industrial action brought many businesses to a standstill, demonstrating the unions’ resolve.
The strike was suspended on June 6 after the Federal Government promised to propose a more substantial minimum wage.
Despite the suspension of the strike, the unions remained firm. The President of the Trade Union Congress (TUC), Festus Osifo emphasised that the unions would not accept a marginal increase.
“No, we also told them that it’s not that we’d get to the table, and you start adding ₦1, ₦2, ₦3,000 as you were doing and we got some good guarantees here and there that they would do something good,” Osifo stated.
Adding to the complexity, the 36 state governors have declared the Federal Government’s N60,000 minimum wage proposal unsustainable.
Halima Ahmed, Acting Director of Media Affairs and Public Relations of the Nigeria Governors’ Forum, noted that if the proposal is accepted, many states would allocate their entire monthly federal funds to salaries, leaving little for other essential services.
The governors have appealed for a fair and sustainable minimum wage that does not cripple state finances.

"Nigeria, Benin Republic agree on single-entry declaration form for border crossing",https://nairametrics.com/2024/06/08/nigeria-benin-republic-agree-on-single-entry-declaration-form-for-border-crossing/,Nairametrics,"The Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) has announced that Nigeria and Benin Republic have reached an agreement to implement a single-entry declaration form for border crossings between the two countries.
Mr. Iheanacho Earnest-Ojike, the Kebbi Area Controller of NCS, revealed this after a closed-door meeting between NCS officials and representatives from Benin Republic held in Anguwar Sule Wara, a border town in Benin Republic, on Sunday.
During the briefing to the press, Earnest-Ojike recounted that this decision follows a prior meeting on May 21, where the Foreign Ministers of Nigeria and Benin Republic convened to discuss bilateral matters aimed at enhancing the smooth flow of trade and commerce between the two nations.
He said, “The meeting aimed at bringing the border crossing between Tsamiya in Nigeria and Anguwar Sule Wata in Benin Republic back to live through infrastructural development in line with renewed hope initiative of President Bola Tinubu.”
“The meeting was also to strengthen social and economic interaction as well as expand trade and commerce between the citizens of the two countries,”
He stated, “The meeting now is in continuation and final agreement to the previous one, as we have now agreed to have a single-entry declaration form that citizens of both countries will use for border crossing.”
He reiterated, “Both countries are signatories to World Trade Organisation (WTO) and World Customs Organisation (WCO), which have the principles of border post.”
Earnest-Ojike further explained that the two countries would establish a joint border agency inspection for goods and persons, asserting, “it is going to be one-stop border post at the Segbana border.”
The controller expressed optimism that the agreement reached would advance the course of regional integration between Nigeria and Benin Republic.

"FG seeks Korea’s investment in electric vehicle projects in Nigeria, assures of incentives",https://nairametrics.com/2024/06/06/fg-seeks-koreas-investment-in-electric-vehicle-projects-in-nigeria-assures-of-incentives/,Nairametrics,"The federal government of Nigeria wants its South Korean counterpart to invest in electric vehicle projects in Nigeria.
This was disclosed by Nigeria’s Minister of Foreign Affairs, Yusuf Tuggar via his X page on Wednesday. 
The request was made during his meeting with a  Korean official at the sidelines of the Korea-Africa 2-day Summit. 

The summit already saw the South Korean government pledging about $24 billion for the development and trade benefits of African countries including Nigeria. 
Nigeria’s Request  
Tuggar disclosed that Nigeria was conducive enough to accommodate Korea’s electric vehicle projects. 
The call is apparently part of the Nigerian government’s move to diversify its economic from overdependence on crude oil products. 
He stated,  
“During a productive bilateral meeting at the Korea-Africa Business Summit, I engaged with my Korean counterpart to explore enhanced cooperation.  
“We focused on strategic areas such as Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG), automotive processes, and potential investments in electric vehicle projects.  
“I emphasized Nigeria’s commitment to facilitating Korean investments with incentives and ensuring the security of Korean citizens and assets.” 
Also, Tuggar acknowledged the significant contributions of the Korea International Cooperation Agency (KOICA) in Nigeria, particularly in education and entrepreneurship. 
He called for the expansion of these initiatives, advocating for increased support in language training and cultural exchange programs. 
He reiterated Nigeria’s aspiration for a seat on the United Nations Security Council, highlighting the country’s role in Africa and our commitment to promoting denuclearization and peace in crisis-stricken regions. 
“In defense, I called for heightened cooperation, seeking support in access to kinetic and non-kinetic weaponry to address the conflicts in the North-East of Nigeria and surrounding communities,” he added. 
More insights 
The Nigerian government  had revealed it graced the Africa-Korea Summit seeking to strengthen economic ties with the Republic of Korea, after exporting alloys and unwrought aluminium worth N3,400,420,000 to the country, late last year. 
This is amid the Korea-Nigeria bilateral trade(import) which reached about N304,619,077,676.23 in the last quarter of the 2023 financial year. 
From the Korean side, 
it prides itself on its Korean businesses whose presence in Nigeria is playing a huge role in resource development and construction. 
“In construction, the total value of orders received by Korean companies reached US$ 15 billion in 2020, which means that Nigeria is by far the biggest construction market to Korea among Sub-Sahara African countries,” the statement on the Korean government website partly reads. 
According to data from the Korean government, InvestKorea, South Korea’s automobile industry produced more than 400,000 electric vehicles, and exports reached 267,000 units in 2022, making Korea, the world’s fifth-largest automobile producer, with its home-based Hyundai Motor Group emerging as the world’s 5th largest electric car seller last year, following BYD, Tesla, VW and Stellantis, as of 2023. 
Nairametrics previously reported that several companies are entering Nigeria’s electric vehicle industry, planning to assemble thousands of EVs locally, driven by the rising petrol prices and the government’s removal of fuel subsidies, making EVs an attractive alternative for Nigerians.  
Hence, FG’s plan to offer incentives to Korea is its way of attracting investment from a big player in EV production. 
The Director General of the National Automotive Design and Development Council (NADDC), Mr Joseph Osanipin, had said the government recognised the level of investment EVs could bring to the country, adding that the current administration was committed to collaborating with relevant stakeholders to support such innovations.

Struggling Nigerian students in UK turn to food charity for help amid fear of deportation,https://nairametrics.com/2024/06/01/struggling-nigerian-students-in-uk-turn-to-food-charity-for-help-amid-fear-of-deportation/,Nairametrics,"Nigerian students at Teesside University in the United Kingdom are reportedly seeking aid from a food charity after being ordered to leave the UK due to the naira devaluation that has made it difficult for them to pay their tuition fees on time. 
According to a BBC report, the students were blocked from their studies at Teesside and reported to the Home Office after the value of Nigeria’s naira plummeted, wiping out their savings. 
The group of students has now turned to Thornaby’s Sprouts Community Food Charity (SCFC), where the influx of affected diaspora students go after being hit with a heavy economic crisis. 
The Manager of SCFC,  Debbie Fixter, told BBC that 75% of its clients are the affected students from Nigeria. 
SCFC coordinates various activities and provides food either for free or at a minimal cost, in addition to clothing and household essentials. 
In recent months, the charity observed a shift in its clientele, with the majority now being Nigerian master’s degree students from Teesside University. 
On its part, the university said it was providing support and international applicants must provide evidence of sufficient funds when applying for a visa. 
Charity now runs at “Maximum Capacity” 
Ms Fixter said her charity was currently at “maximum capacity” as a result of the situation and called on Teesside University to offer more support. 
She said the university had so far been proactive and offered a welcome £500 donation of Sainsbury’s vouchers after being informed of the situation, but called it a “drop in the ocean” in terms of what was needed to support the influx of students at the charity. 
The university said It worked closely with community organisations to signpost students back to its own support services and had provided vouchers and contributions to ensure the organisations could offer support to students. 
“Teesside University remains a popular destination for students from across the world who choose to study here because of its global reputation for excellence in teaching and research.  
“All international applicants need to provide evidence that they have sufficient funds to cover tuition fees and living costs as part of the visa application process,” a spokesperson of the university said.  
The university is offering “case by case” support to those affected by the situation in Nigeria.  
Backstory 
Earlier, Nairemetrics reported that the e drastic devaluation of Nigeria’s currency has affected the ability of Nigerian students at Teesside University in the United Kingdom to pay their tuition fees on time. 
They have now been forced to discontinue their studies and leave the UK. 
Some of these students, devastated by the situation, told the BBC that they felt driven to despair by what they saw as the university’s insensitive handling of their payment difficulties. 
According to a university spokesperson, non-payment breached the conditions of their visa sponsorship, leaving the university with “no choice” but to inform the Home Office.

ICYMI: Davido’s new crypto token that lost 93% after launch,https://nairametrics.com/2024/05/30/icymi-davidos-new-crypto-token-that-lost-93-after-launch/,Nairametrics,"Nigeria’s Afrobeat superstar, David  Adeleke (Davido), on Wednesday, announced the launch of a crypto token or memecoin inspired by himself.
The token known as “Timeless Davido” ($DAVIDO) is the latest addition to the new wave of celebrity-themed memecoins making the news in the crypto industry at the moment.
Davido announced the launch of the $Davido token on his X handle on Wednesday and the tweet was acknowledged by the official Solana handle.
This resulted in a frenzy in the Nigerian X space and a surge in the market capitalization of the token hours after its launch.
Although the rave around the token has cooled off just a day after its launch, here are five important things to note about the $Davido token.
Launched on Solana blockchain 
The $Davido token was launched on the Solana blockchain and it was created on Wednesday using the popular Platform Pump Fun which allows crypto users to create a token in a matter of minutes.
Crypto research tool, Lookonchain, reported that Davido received 7.5 SOL worth $1,275 as startup capital which he used to create the $Davido token.
The Solana blockchain is known for processing over 65,000 transactions in a second and has low fees. 1 Sol is currently worth N238,769
Profit of $473,000 in 11 hours 
After creating his $Davido token with his 7.5 SOL initial capital, Davido spent 7 SOL to buy 203 million $Davido tokens which made up about 20.3% of the total supply.
He sold 121.88 million $Davido tokens, making a profit of over $473,000 in just 11 hours. He still has an unrealized profit of $207,000.
$Davido token value has plunged by 93% 
Despite the excitement and the rave created online by the launch of the $Davido tokens, the party was short-lived as the memecoin lost over 93% of its value by the next day.
The token is currently down by 93% from its highest point on Wednesday. According to data from CoinMarketCap, the coin is currently trading at $0.000010 just a day after its launch. The coin also has a current liquidity of $291,000.
Not Davido’s first crypto project 
$Davido token launch is not the first time the Afrobeat superstar has got involved in the wild world of cryptocurrencies.
Techcabal reported that the superstar previously launched $echoke on the Binance Smart Chain to provide a host of services, including non-fungible tokens, entertainment, media, and hospitality. The project was short-lived and was long forgotten.
The journey for the newly launched $Davido token remains uncertain for long-term holders of the token given the unsavory news of the coin losing 93% of its value the next day.
What to know
The $Davido memecoin is the latest addition to the recent wave of celebrity-themed tokens in the crypto industry. It remains uncertain the long-term trajectory of the $Davido token and whether it would be able to increase its valuation allowing its long-term holders to profit from it.
Memecoins are increasingly becoming a very important part of the crypto industry with an overall market cap of about $66 billion.
Nairametrics earlier reported the top five promising memecoins of 2024 who are currently increasing in valuation and pulling a bullish trend in the crypto market.

The US explained that funding is critical because the humanitarian responses in Nigeria and other West African countries are vastly underfunded while the needs are far outpacing the assistance available. 

The statement partly adds,  

“The United States, through USAID, is providing nearly $176 million in additional humanitarian assistance for the Sahel and Lake Chad Basin regions of West Africa in response to deteriorating security conditions and increasing humanitarian needs in communities cut off from assistance due to conflict.  

“This additional funding from USAID – which includes funds from the recently passed bipartisan supplemental appropriation – will support communities in Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, and Nigeria facing staggering humanitarian needs amid conflict, food insecurity, and displacement.  

“These funds will be provided through UN and NGO partners, including the UN World Food Program, UNICEF, and the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. 

“These funds will allow our partners to reach additional people with food assistance, nutrition, safe drinking water, emergency health care, and protection for the most vulnerable, along with other vital aid.” 

The United States seized the moment to urge other donors to join in scaling up assistance to West Africa so as to help save lives and alleviate the suffering of the most vulnerable in the region.

The United States government announced about $533 million in humanitarian assistance for Nigeria and other countries in the Lake Chad region, in 2018. 

The United States prides itself as a leading donor to the humanitarian response in the Sahel and Lake Chad Basin regions.  
The assistance is part of the US move to strengthen and sustain bilateral relations with Nigeria. 
This comes after the sixth U.S.-Nigeria Binational Commission which was held in Abuja on April 29-30, 2024. 
The U.S. delegation welcomed Tuggar’s 4D policy of Democracy, Development, Demography, and Diaspora and acknowledged Nigerian ideas to incorporate U.S. contributions to meeting these goals.

When Atiku Abubakar was harassed in the Peoples Democratic Party, it was Bourdillon he ran to for support and it was in Bourdillon that he got the needed support and later contested for the presidency of this country,” Shettima stated during the inauguration of the Vice Presidential Lodge constructed by the Federal Capital Territory Administration in Abuja.
Reacting through a statement by his Media Adviser, Paul Ibe, on Sunday, Atiku said Shettima “goofed,” adding that “truth be told, it was Tinubu that actually benefited immensely from Atiku’s goodwill.”
The former vice president stated that without his support, Tinubu would not have enjoyed his tenure as Lagos State governor and might have been impeached.
He stated, “But for Atiku’s support, hinged on his pro-democracy instincts and the rule of law, Tinubu’s tenure as governor of Lagos State would have been rough with a wide possibility of termination of his political career.
“For some time, and especially leading up to the 2023 election, there has been a deliberate attempt to distort the history of the politics of the early Fourth Republic by ascribing the AC, the political platform that Atiku ran in 2007, as Tinubu’s party.
“Nothing can be further from the truth. Vice President Shettima, obviously carried away with the euphoria of the unveiling of his official residence as Vice President, repeated the same lie.”
Atiku urged Shettima to avoid commenting on topics about which he had little or no knowledge.
“Shettima needs to be reminded that Atiku did not run under the Action Congress of Nigeria, but Action Congress. AC came out of a coalition of Advance Congress of Democrats, formed mainly by PDM members and other associates and Tinubu’s faction of Alliance for Democracy.
“Moreover, Tinubu was not in a position to lend the platform to Atiku as erroneously suggested, as he (Atiku) was nominated by all the delegates from all the states.

Tanzania woos Nigerian investors to explore abundant resources,https://punchng.com/tanzania-woos-nigerian-investors-to-explore-abundant-resources/,Punch,"The Tanzanian Government has urged Nigerians with attractive business opportunities to tap abundant economic resources in their country.
Dr Binilith Mahenge, the Chairman, Board of Directors, Tanzania Investment Centre, said the visit to Enugu was to present business opportunities to Nigerian investors that would be mutually beneficial to both Nigeria and Tanzania.
He spoke at an event on Thursday in Enugu, tagged “Tanzania Investment Forum” with members of the Enugu Chamber of Commerce, Industry, Mines and Agriculture (ECCIMA), in attendance.
The theme of the event was: “Strategic Investment Form For Prospective Investors in Enugu, Nigeria”.
Although Mahenge acknowledged that there were Nigerian investors in Tanzania, but noted that the number was infinitesimal compared with the avalanche of business opportunities yet to be harnessed in the East African nation.
He said: “We are encouraging and advocating for more investments as there are many entrepreneurs in Nigeria whom we want to capture more of the available business opportunities.
“Presently, investment is being done by every country of the world including developing countries because through investment, jobs can be created, currencies of other countries can be attracted and influx of new technologies.
“So, everyone wants investment in his country.
“Tanzania is a peaceful country and from 1961 when we got independence with six successive governments, the country has always been in peace.
“We have abundant natural resources which Nigerians can invest in and our economic growth will make their investment very comfortable,” he assured.
He, however, urged Nigerians to invest in agriculture, tourism and other areas, adding with that Africans could invest, and exchange their technologies and businesses.”
Mahenge extolled the inquisitiveness and willingness of the investors in Enugu on the procedures on how to invest in Tanzania noting that they demonstrated willingness especially with the questions they asked.
He, nonetheless, expressed displeasure by the way Africans were doing in business, stressing that more needed to be done given the continent’s rich natural resources.
“Each country has what they produce. It is better for us to exchange our products within the African continent as we have the capabilities,” he said.
Earlier, the Acting Tanzania High Commission in Nigeria, Mrs Judica Nagunwa, explained that the country’s main goal was to inform Nigerians especially, investors in Enugu to bring their businesses, explore the potential opportunities in Tanzania and invest in them .
Nagunwa represented by Mr Philbert Peter, the First Secretary-Economic Affairs, Tanzania High Commission, Abuja, said the Commission covered 15 West Africa countries with Nigeria inclusive and was responsible for the country’s economic diplomats to promote investment and ease of trade.
“I came here in April to explore the possibility of the embassy’s participation in 2024 Enugu Trade Fair.
“When we visited Enugu, we presented the potential we had in Tanzania to ECCIMA President, Odeiga Jideonwo.
“But he said that he wanted members of ECCIMA to be informed about these opportunities and we spoke to Tanzania Government who sent Mahenge to come and speak to investors in Enugu,” he said.
Presenting the opportunities, the Senior Investment Officer, Tanzania, Gaudence Mmassy, said Nigerians could invest in Tanzania given its economic stability, labour force, rich natural resources, peace and political stability as well as access to market.
He explained that the investors could invest in Agriculture and agro processing, pharmaceutical, tourism, real estate, clean energy, mining and metals and oil and gas sectors.
“There are $800 million to $1 billion value opportunities in medicine and medical devices with government’s goal of reducing import bills.
“Nigeria with less than 28 companies in Tanzania created 1,990 jobs with $1,358.42 investment value,” he said.
In a welcome address, ECCIMA’s President, Jideonwo, said the meeting would lead the people expanding their business empires to Tanzania while Tanzania people would also find Enugu as the most suitable for investment destination in Nigeria.
Jideonwo noted that the programme was one of their efforts towards building a lasting and profitable bilateral trade and business relation starting with the African countries.
“It is our hope that those of us in Agriculture, ICT, Health, Construction, Manufacturing of consumer goods, financial services, environment and energy, and real estate, will after this programme further plan a trip to Tanzania to sign MOU for bilateral investment,” he said.

LP not upset Obi opposed Obidient Movement Directorate – Spokesman,https://punchng.com/lp-not-upset-obi-opposed-obidient-movement-directorate-spokesman/,Punch,"The National Working Committee of the Labour Party has said it was not offended by Thursday’s outburst of the party’s presidential candidate, Peter Obi, over the controversial creation of the Obidient Movement directorate.
The LP NWC said Obi had the right to express his grievance, adding that there was no plan or contemplation to relieve Obi of his party leadership role.
The National Publicity Secretary of the LP, Obiora Ifoh, disclosed this to our correspondent in an exclusive interview while responding to questions on the alleged conflict between Obi and the party.
Obi had last week openly criticised the leadership of the Labour Party over the newly created Directorate of Obidient Movement and disowned the group’s self-styled leader, Marcel Ngogbehei.
According to him, the Obidient Movement, a major backbone of his presidential quest, is far bigger than the scope of any political party.
In a swift reaction, the party’s NWC announced that it had rechristened the contentious directorate to reflect the Directorate of Mobilisation and Integration.
Speaking with The PUNCH, Ifoh said the party had no hard feelings about Obi’s rebuttal.
When quizzed on why their candidate didn’t air his grievance with the National Chairman, Julius Abure or the NWC before going public, the spokesman declined to comment.
He said, “Why would the party be offended? The LP, as we always, say is united. We are not offended. I mean, if we were offended, we would make a statement in that regard. He is still the national leader of the Labour Party.
“Again, how is what he said an outrage? The national leader of the party just made a clarification, which is clear enough. He said the Obidient Movement is a group of people looking forward to good governance. I agree. He also explained that the Obidient people are not necessarily members of any particular political party. As a matter of fact, you can find Obidients in other political parties.
“He only advised that instead of having a directorate for the Obidients, we should have converted it to a directorate of mobilisation, which has been immediately corrected. We now have a directorate of mobilisation, which will be inaugurated tomorrow (Saturday). I think his information was very clear enough and we should respect it.”
Obi’s campaign spokesman, Yunusa Tanko, also did not believe his principal’s open disapproval should cause bad blood in the party.
He said, “Sometimes it is normal that things happen like this. Later, you will see a strong bond being established as long as it is the soul of the party that is being salvaged from those who are trying to make it look very bad.
“You may find out that the party will be stronger later on, and where there are frictions, solutions will be found. There is nothing that doesn’t have a solution.”
The human activist also insisted that Ngogbehei and other persons being nominated were not the faces behind the Obidient Movement.
“The position of the Obidient Movement is very clear. They speak in unison and you will find that it is an amorphous organisation that has a strong voice. Everybody who wants good governance knows a thief is a thief. Everybody also knows that this particular government is not prioritising its expenditure and our educational system is in shambles. There is hunger in the land and the dollar has also increased beyond what it’s supposed to be.
“These are things that the Obedient Movement speaks to. They want good governance and they speak in that particular direction. Therefore, every one of them is a leader in his capacity and at the same time a member. This is because they speak with one voice. That was why His Excellency came out and clearly mentioned that there is nobody that is heading them.
“It is only the words of Peter Obi and the dream of a new Nigeria that is bonding this particular Obidient movement strong. I hope you know that even he himself is sometimes challenged by the movement. But again, it is only targeted towards good leadership,” he stated.
The Obidient Movement, which comprises young Nigerians who see the hope of a new Nigeria in the candidacy of Obi, was birthed in the build-up of the 2023 general election
The impact of the group was felt when it powered the Labour Party to a stunning performance at the February 25 presidential and national legislative elections.
To date, LP has one elected governor, 35 members of the House of Representatives and seven senators to its credit.

The governor had imposed a 24-hour curfew on the Mangu LGA after some bandits invaded the Pushit and Sabon-Gari communities and killed 13 persons.
Some residents were equally injured while several houses were burnt during the attack.
To avoid a reprisal and the escalation of the situation, the governor had imposed a curfew.
Announcing the lifting of the curfew on Sunday, Mutfwang, in a statement by his Director of Press and Public, Gyang Bere, said the decision was taken after consultation with the State Security Council, following the restoration of normalcy in the area.

"Fuel, foods lead as imports hit N12tn",https://punchng.com/fuel-foods-lead-as-imports-hit-n12tn/,Punch,"Refined petroleum products and agricultural food imports constituted the major items imported by Nigerians into the country in the first quarter of 2024, the National Bureau of Statistics has stated in a new report.
This was as total imports for Q1 2024 stood at N12.64tn representing a 39.65 per cent increase from N9.05tn in Q4 2023 and a 95.53 per cent rise from N6.47tn in Q1 2023.
While the import of raw materials by manufacturers gulped N1.5tn, citizens spent N920.54bn to bring in agricultural goods, the NBS in its Foreign Trade Statistics disclosed on Sunday.
“The share of total imports accounted for 39.75 per cent of total trade in the first quarter of 2024 with the value of imports amounting to N12.64tn in Q1, 2024. This value indicates an increase of 39.65 per cent over the value recorded in Q4 2023 (N9.05tn) and rose by 95.53 per cent compared to the value recorded in Q1 2023 (N6.46tn). The merchandise trade balance for Q1 2024 stood positive at N6.5tn,” the NBS report stated in part.
The NBS said China was Nigeria’s top trading partner on the import side, contributing 23.18 per cent to the total imports. Other significant import partners included India (8.46 per cent), the United States (7.98 per cent), Belgium (7.56 per cent), and the Netherlands (4.68 per cent).
It said agricultural goods imported were valued at N920.54bn, reflecting a 29.45 per cent increase compared to N711.14bn in Q4 2023 and a 95.28 per cent rise compared to N471.39bn in Q1 2023.
Similarly, raw material imports by manufacturers stood at N1.47tn, a 51.78 per cent increase from N966.80bn in Q4 2023 and a 164.18 per cent rise from N555.47bn in Q1 2023.
Key imported commodities included motor spirit ordinary, gas oil, durum wheat, cane sugar meant for sugar refinery, and other liquefied petroleum gases.
The report added, “In the first quarter of 2024, China ranked highest among the top trading partners on the import side, followed by India, United States of America, Belgium, and The Netherlands. The most traded commodities were motor spirit ordinary, gas oil, durum wheat (Not in seeds), cane sugar meant for sugar refinery, and other liquefied petroleum gases and other gaseous hydrocarbons.
“The value of agricultural goods imported in Q1 2024 was N920.54bn, reflecting an increase of 29.45 per cent when compared to N711.14bn in Q4 2023, and a 95.28 per cent rise compared to N471.39bn in Q1 2023.
“In Q1 2024, raw material imports were valued at N1,467.41 billion. This represents a 51.78 per cent increase from N966.80 billion in Q4 2023 and a significant rise of 164.18 per cent from N555.47bn in Q1 2023.
“In the first quarter of 2024, solid mineral imports were valued at N71.38bn. This represents a 21.15 per cent increase from N58.92bn in Q4 2023 and a 59.23 per cent increase from N44.83bn in Q1 2023.”
In the recent past, there have conflicting and contrary views by various stakeholders to open the border for the import of food products as a measure to curb surging inflation.
Although President Bola Tinubu has refuted plans to permit food imports from neighbouring countries, the government has set in motion a plan to suspend the payment of import duties on staple food items, drugs, and other essential items for an initial period of six months as a measure to curb inflation, the Chairman of the Presidential Committee on Fiscal Policy and Tax Reforms, Taiwo Oyedele informed Journalists last week.
In Nigeria, a food crisis looms large, challenging the nation’s stability. Food prices have surged, with food inflation reaching 40.5 per cent.
Among the hardest-hit commodities is rice, a dietary staple. In the past year alone, rice prices have skyrocketed by 169 per cent, reaching nearly N90,000 per bag in March and April. This sharp increase in food costs is placing immense strain on households across the country, exacerbating an already fragile economy.
It’s estimated that around 31 million Nigerians may face severe food shortages by August this year.
Based on international standard classification, the statistics agency said that the top-ranked group import was “mineral fuels” with N4.436tn representing 35.09 per cent of total imports; this was followed by “machinery and transport equipment” with N3.17tn (25.08 per cent of total imports) and “Chemicals & related products” with N1.786tn (14.13 per cent of total imports).
“On the other hand, total imports of agricultural goods in Q1, 2024 stood at N920.54bn or 7.28 per cent of total imports.
The major agriculture goods imported in Q1, 2024 included ‘Durum wheat (not in seeds)’ from Canada with N130.26bn and Lithuania with  N98.63bn. This was followed by ‘Blue whitings (Micromesistius potassium, Micromesistius australis) meat, frozen.’ from the Netherlands valued at N16.67bn.
Meanwhile, Nigeria’s foreign exchange earnings grew in the first three months of 2024 as the foreign trade surplus rose to N6.52tn due to naira devaluation.
According to new data from the National Bureau of Statistics, Nigeria’s total import bill stood at N12.64tn, while total exports amounted to N19.17tn, indicating that the country was able to earn N6.52tn worth of foreign exchange in the process.
This figure is a significant recovery from the N1.41tn trade deficit recorded in the previous quarter (Q4 2023) and the N927.2 billion in the same period (Q1) of 2023.
The first quarter trade surplus marks a historic peak, surpassing previous records dating back to 2009, with the closest figure being N5.74 trillion in Q4 2011.
The record data is also fueled by exchange rate depreciation which means the trade surplus when converted to Naira will be higher than in any other period in history.
The report stated that total exports for Q1 2024 were valued at N19.17tn, representing a 51 per cent increase from the previous quarter’s N12.69tn and a 195.47 per cent rise from N6.49tn recorded in Q1 2023.
France emerged as the leading destination for Nigerian exports, accounting for 11.09 per cent of the total export value, followed by Spain (10.56 per cent), the Netherlands (8.85 per cent), India (8.41 per cent), and the United States (6.84 per cent).
The statistics agency added that major export commodities included crude oil, liquefied natural gas, sesamum seeds, urea, and superior-quality cocoa beans.
Crude oil exports accounted for 80.80 per cent of total exports with a value of N15.49tn, representing a 50.20 per cent increase from N10.31tn in Q4 2023 and a remarkable 200.79 per cent rise from N5.15tn in Q1 2023.
Revenue from agricultural exports also saw significant growth, amounting to N1.04tn, up by 123.08 per cent from N463.97bn in Q4 2023 and by 270.13 per cent from N279.64bn in Q1 2023.
The report read, “Total exports in Q1 2024 we’re valued at N19.17tn, reflecting a 51.00 per cent increase compared to N12.69tn in Q4 2023 and a 195.47 per cent rise compared to N6.49tn in Q1 2023.
“In Q1 2024, the top trading export partners were France, Spain, the Netherlands, India, and the United States of America. The most exported m commodities included crude oil, liquefied natural gas, sesamum seeds, urea (whether or not in aqueous solution), and superior-quality cocoa beans.

“Crude oil exports in Q1 2024 were valued at N15.49tn, a rise of 50.20 per cent from N10.31tn in Q4 2023 and by 200.7 per cent from N5.15tn in Q1 2023.”
The FX reform implemented last June as part of the Federal Government’s measures to revive the economy has led to a large devaluation of the naira.
While the naira has continued to depreciate, the West African CFA franc, a legal tender in Benin, Burkina Faso, Côte d’Ivoire, Guinea-Bissau, Mali, Niger, Senegal and Togo, has appreciated.
This made some goods produced in Nigeria cheaper than other African countries.

Israel-Palestine conflict: Nigeria joins call for ceasefire,https://punchng.com/israel-palestine-conflict-nigeria-joins-call-for-ceasefire/,Punch,"Nigeria has urged world leaders to back United States President Joe Biden’s ceasefire proposal to halt the escalating violence in the Israel-Palestine conflict in a bold appeal for peace.
Nigeria’s Minister of Foreign Affairs, Ambassador Yusuf Tuggar, made the call for immediate global action to protect innocent lives.
“Nigeria assures the United States of its support to bring about a complete cessation of violence and an end to the senseless loss of human lives and manmade humanitarian crises,” declared Tuggar in a statement signed by his media aide, AlKasim Abdulkadir, on Sunday.
The minister emphasised the urgent need for a coordinated international effort to resolve the conflict swiftly.
“The Biden ceasefire proposal should be embraced by world leaders and the totality of the international community to intensify efforts towards a speedy resolution of the conflict, and the immediate cessation of the attendant extreme violence in Gaza and all other innocent civilians affected by the conflict.
“Equally important is the continuous, sufficient and unhindered provision of lifesaving humanitarian supplies and services for civilians,” he added.
Biden proposal, which includes a permanent ceasefire, increased humanitarian aid, the release of hostages, and a major reconstruction effort, is seen by Nigeria as the best path forward.
“Biden plan presents a clear path towards progress and the conditions required for peace,” Tuggar noted, expressing concern over the ongoing bloodshed and its implications for global justice.
Continuous and unhindered humanitarian aid was crucial, the minister added, underscoring the importance of lifesaving support for civilians caught in the conflict.
The ongoing conflict has seen significant casualties. Israel’s National Council for the Child reports that 1,200 Israelis, including 38 children, were killed in Hamas attacks on October 7th of last year.
In response, Israeli bombardments in Gaza have resulted in the deaths of thousands, with the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza reporting 36,731 fatalities, including many children.
Recent United Nations figures estimate that at least 7,797 children have been killed in Gaza, based on identified bodies.
The UN had on Friday placed the Israeli military on a list of parties accused of committing violations against children in conflict zones.

Arsenal end Osimhen interest after swap deal claims,https://punchng.com/arsenal-end-osimhen-interest-after-swap-deal-claims/,Punch,"Premier League giants Arsenal have reportedly dropped their interest in Napoli striker, Victor Osimhen, due to his €130m price tag amid player swap rumours, PUNCH Sports Extra reports.
After four successful seasons at Napoli, Osimhen is expected to call time on his career with the 2022/23 Serie A champions this summer, as confirmed by club president Aurelio de Laurentiis.
The Partenopei have fought hard to keep hold of the Nigeria international and agreed a new contract with their star striker last December, but his terms only run until the summer of 2026.
With Osimhen’s contract also including a release clause worth around €130m (£110.6m), De Laurentiis has resigned himself to losing the former Lille man to one of Europe’s financial powerhouses ahead of the 2024/25 season.
Arsenal have been one of a handful of clubs tipped to move for Osimhen, alongside Chelsea, Paris Saint-Germain and Real Madrid, although the latter will not make an approach due to the recent capture of Kylian Mbappe.
It has also been reported that new Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca is against the signing of the 25-year-old as well, as he does not believe that Osimhen is a striker who can link play and drop deep, which is one of his principal requirements.
As a result, a two-way fight could have materialised between PSG and Arsenal, the latter of whom were apparently informed that a part-exchange deal involving Emile Smith Rowe and Takehiro Tomiyasu could have been their ticket to an agreement.
However, according to Sky Italia, Arsenal have informed Napoli that they are not bowing to their £110.6m demands, especially after breaking their own transfer record with the £105m capture of Declan Rice last year.
Arsenal still rate the striker highly but cannot justify forking out a nine-figure fee, which is also the case with most of Osimhen’s other suitors, so De Laurentiis may be forced to relent on demanding that the Nigerian’s release clause is paid in full.
The Napoli president is now under added pressure to accept a lower fee for the Nigerian due to the arrival of Antonio Conte, who wants to reunite with Chelsea’s Romelu Lukaku in one of his first acts as head coach.
PSG are now considered the favourites for Osimhen’s signature, as the ex-Lille man is not keen on moving to Saudi Arabia, and the French champions will save €200m (£170.1m) in yearly wages now that Mbappe has departed.
Osimhen topped the Serie A scoring charts in the 2022/23 season with 26 strikes and netted 15 times in 2023/24 missing a large part of the season due to injuries and the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations.

"Benin wants to beat Nigeria in Abidjan, says Rohr",https://thenationonlineng.net/benin-wants-to-beat-nigeria-in-abidjan-says-rohr/amp/,Thenation,"German coach Gernot Rohr  has yet predicted a difficult  match as The Cheetahs of  Republic of Benin tango with the Super Eagles of Nigeria in their 2026 FIFA World Cup Group C qualifier today at the Felix Houphouet Boigny Stadium in Abidjan.
Rohr, who switched coaching roles from Nigeria to Benin, said the game offers the Cheetahs the opportunity to avenge their loss to their illustrious neighbours in the  2021 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) qualifier at the Charles de Gaulle Stadium in Port Novo.        
While the Super Eagles have only secured three points in their opening three matches, The Cheetahs only on Friday secured a shock 1-0 win over Rwanda to jump to third position with four points while Nigeria sits in fifth position in their six-team section that also houses Lesotho, South Africa and Zimbabwe. 
“Everything is possible in this group,” Rohr told NationSport exclusively from Abidjan. “Who could believe that Lesotho will be on the top after three matches?”
Though the Super Eagles are pressed for the maximum points in today’s Group C match, Rohr said the coach George Finidi-led side must brace for stiff resistance, adding that The Cheetahs won’t be overawed.
“Our game on Monday (today) is a crucial one,” the former Bayern Munich defender, who qualified  Nigeria for the 2018 FIFA World Cup as well as the 2019 and 2021 AFCONs, further said. “Nigeria needs to win and Benin wants to win.
“The last match between the  two teams in Porto Novo is a bad memory for Benin.”
The willy-old fox who ironically supervised that defeat of Benin in Port Novo has, in the meantime, taken a potshot at Nigeria’s inconsistency since he left the Super Eagles’ job.     
“Since I left, three coaches arrived already and the style of the team changed with some new players,” he affirmed. “It will be an interesting game for all of us.”

"Why Nigeria should transition from open grazing to ranching, by Governor Radda",https://thenationonlineng.net/why-nigeria-should-transition-from-open-grazing-to-ranching-by-governor-radda/amp/,Thenation,"Governor Dikko Umar Radda of Katsina state has suggested a transition to ranching as a more sustainable and profitable alternative to open grazing.
He stated that implementing this policy shift to ranching has helped ensure that Katsina’s lands remain cultivated despite increasing insecurity and challenges to agriculture in the area.
The Nation may recall that a bill seeking to ban open grazing and the establishment of ranches for herders in the country has already passed a second reading at the Senate.
The governor who made the call during a television program: “Politics on TVC’’, also emphasised the benefits of ranching, saying it is more profitable
He said: “There is a need for us to encourage ranching. I’m not supporting or opposing, but I’m saying there is a need for us to embrace ranching because it is more profitable.”
‘’ranching offers value addition and is more secure compared to open grazing, which often leads to conflicts.
“We can’t take the herders off the streets just in a very short time. We need to give time for people to be enlightened. There’ll be a lot of sensitization and encouragement for people to go into ranching because it is more profitable and more secure.”
The governor also stressed that despite significant security issues, a substantial portion of land in Katsina is still being actively farmed.
He said: “I’m telling you, 90% of the lands in Katsina are being cultivated despite the insecurity. There has been production in many areas affected by insecurity.”
On the issue of minimum wage, the governor identified some major constraints to its implementation including financial constraints facing the State, contrasting economic situations compared to more affluent states like Lagos.
He said: “My monthly allocation has not exceeded 10 billion Naira. When you look at the wage bill, pensions, and overhead costs, it takes over 50% of what we collect.
 “Lagos is making about 60 billion Naira a month, while Katsina makes about 1.5 billion. How can you compare a state earning 60 billion with one earning 1.5 billion? Even with all mechanisms in place, Katsina cannot collect 10% of what Lagos collects in taxes.”

He spoke against the backdrop of the Super Eagles of Nigeria’s 1-1 draw against  Bafana Bafana of South Africa in Uyo, on Friday.
The Nigerian team came from behind to struggle to get the draw at home, in the group stage of world cup qualifiers.
Omokaro said that the super eagles needed more time to play and train together, for better performance.
According to him, the last match was not too bad, but the team could display more skills and adopt an effective pattern to defeat their opponents.
“Though the players played very well individually, they need more collective responsibility to get the expected goals.
“The boys never had time to play together, that’s what happened to them during the match, but they need more togetherness and rigorous training to qualify for the world cup,” he said.
The ex-international also advised the super eagles coach, Finidi George, to look inward for local players that are zealous and thirsty for goals.
“There shouldn’t be automatic shirt for any player for now.
“Their performance should be the determinant to feature in a match, as there must be competition in the camp to allow the best players perform,” Omokaro said.
He, however, appealed to the national team to defeat Benin Republic in the next match, to have meaningful points on the qualifiers table, to make it to the 2026 world cup.
NAN reports that pressure has mounted on the Super Eagles after the draw against Bafana Bafana.
Nigeria, with its third draw, has three points in Group C, while Rwanda, Benin, and South Africa all have four points.
Lesotho leads the group with five points, while Zimbabwe is at the bottom with two points.
This puts Nigeria presently in the fifth position on the table, of the six teams.
The Super Eagles will travel to Abidjan to face Benin Republic in their next 2026 World Cup qualifier.
They will be hoping to get their first win in the match against the Cheetahs of Benin Republic.
The game is scheduled for Monday, with the kick-off fixed at 5.00 p.m. Nigerian time.

Eid-el-Kabir: Kaduna clerics lead campaign to reduce ram prices,https://tribuneonlineng.com/eid-el-kabir-kaduna-clerics-lead-campaign-to-reduce-ram-prices/,Tribune,"Some Muslim and Christian clerics in Kaduna have formed a coalition to call on roadside livestock traders to reduce the price of rams as Eid-el-Kabir approaches.
Led by Pastor Dr. Yohanna Buru, the group toured various animal selling points in Kaduna on Friday and Saturday.
He said the  purpose of their visit was to convey season’s greetings to the livestock sellers and appeal for lower prices on rams and other animals, enabling more Muslims to afford to buy rams for the Sallah celebration.
Pastor Buru emphasized the necessity of this intervention, noting that the price hike has placed the animals beyond the reach of the average Muslim.
The group visited several roadside livestock markets, including those selling sheep, goats, and cattle, as buyers began their preparations for the festivities.
Pastor Buru noted that for the past 10 years, he has visited ram markets during this season, consistently appealing to sellers to reduce prices to make rams more affordable for Muslims during the Sallah festivities.
He added that such efforts also serve to enhance and strengthen Christian-Muslim relationships in the state.
He mentioned that this year’s Eid-el-Kabir celebration comes amidst high living costs, security challenges, and the devaluation of the naira.
“We usually visit sheep markets because sheep are more desirable than goats and cattle during this period. Eid al-Adha generates high profits for roadside livestock traders in Nigeria,” he said.
Pastor Buru highlighted that the Holy Qur’an commemorates Abraham’s willingness to sacrifice his son at Allah’s command, who was then substituted by a ram. This act is perpetuated in Islam through the sacrifice of animals during Eid al-Adha.
He wished Muslims worldwide a happy Sallah in advance and expressed hope for reduced prices.
Similarly, Imam Husaini Ilyasu, the Chief Imam of Udawa Central Mosque and a leader within the Jama’atul Nasrul Islam (JNI) Kaduna, emphasized the need for ram sellers to lower their prices for the Sallah festivities.
He also called on other food sellers to reduce their prices, allowing Muslims to celebrate with joy and happiness.
Responding to the clerics’ appeal, Mallam Musa Dallami, a ram seller along Waff Road, Kaduna, explained that the rising cost of living has impacted all sectors. He noted that the cost of feeding rams and other animals is extremely high, with many rams sourced from distant locations. He added that the removal of fuel subsidies in the country has triggered price increases across the board.
“Don’t blame us for the cost of rams and other animals during this season because we also have to buy food and other supplies for our families,” Dallami said. He urged government intervention to address the rising costs of food and other necessities in the country.
Another ram seller, Sani Musa, at Kasuwar Barnawa market, thanked Pastor Dr. Yohanna Buru and his group for their compassion. However, he insisted that ram prices remain within the reach of average Muslims, although security challenges have led to a scarcity of domestic animals.
It will be recalled that annually during Ramadan, Pastor Buru mobilizes 50 Muslim and Christian scholars to visit markets, urging sellers to cut prices to make food more accessible to citizens.

Mining: FG to expand Marshal Corps to 100 per state,https://tribuneonlineng.com/mining-fg-to-expand-marshal-corps-to-100-per-state/,Tribune,"THE Minister of Solid Minerals Development, Dr Dele Alake, says that plans sre ongoing to increase the number of Mining Marshal Corps from 60 to 100.
The increase would be across the 36 states of the federation and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT).
Alake said this in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Sunday in Abuja.
He said that the move was part of efforts of the Federal Government to secure the mining operating environment aimed at attracting Foreign Direct Investments (FDIs) to boost the economic profile of the country.
NAN reports that the Mining Marshal Corps inaugurated on March 21, were drawn from the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) to combat illegal mining.
The corps has 2,220 personnel, who have been specially trained by the military in modern warfare as a rapid response squad with 60 deployed across the 36 states
“We are looking at adding to the number to get a minimum of 100 in each state from the 60 on ground,” he said.
He said that the President Bola Tinubu`s administration was determined to sanitise the mining sector and reposition it by putting in place policy measures to attract big players to the sector.
Alake said that prospective investors would need assurance of the security of the operating environment, their investment, equipment and personnel.
The minister said that the insecurity situation at mining sites across the federation prompted the president to establish an inter-ministerial committee on Jan.17.
He explained that the committee was to produce a blue print for securing Nigeria`s natural resources, which comprised of mineral sites, marine economy and forests.
The minister, however, said that while deliberations were still on-going by the committee on producing a comprehensive security architecture for the natural resources, the mining marshal corps was established in the interim.
“Insecurity is rife in the forests where the solid minerals are deposited.
“The inter-ministerial efforts are ongoing as set up by the president but I couldn’t wait because of the criticality in curbing the illegality in the sector,” he said.
He said that the initiative was yielding the desired results, as more than 200 suspects had been arrested, with 133 being prosecuted and two foreigners convicted for illegal operations.
According to him, many requests are being received from states for the deployment of marshals in areas identified as sites of illegal mining due to their success.
“Every day, I receive requests from states asking for the deployment of these mining marshals to particular areas in their forests where they notice illegal operations going on.
“And they have gone inside the forests, the operating field to arrest, more than 200 have been arrested, about 133 are being prosecuted right now in various courts across the various states of the country.
“And recently, two foreign nationals were jailed, convicted of operating illegally in the mining sector in Nigeria”, he said.

Three dead in Rivers tanker explosion,https://tribuneonlineng.com/three-dead-in-rivers-tanker-explosion/,Tribune,"THREE persons have died following a tanker explosion in the Obiri-Ikwerre Flyover along the East-West Road in Port Harcourt, the Rivers State capital on Tuesday.
According to Channels Television, the incident, which occurred at about 9:30a.m, involved a tanker conveying what is believed to be Liquefied Natural Gas, which fell over, crushed a vehicle and exploded while trying to navigate the roundabout.
Confirming the incident in a telephone conversation, the state Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Grace Iringe-Koko, said the victims were burnt beyond recognition when the tanker fell on the vehicle they were commuting in.
“Yes, I can confirm that two persons died in the tanker fire. The commissioner of police and I are on the ground as I speak to you,” she said.
“The fire has been put out but the area is till dangerous because the gas is still leaking. So motorists are advised to take alternative routes to avoid any further casualty.”
The impact of the explosion was felt kilometres away as some of the residents said their windows were smashed while others reported feeling the vibrations.
At press time, men of the fire service were still trying to put out the inferno, while a crowd of onlookers gathered around with heavy security presence also observed.
Channels Television, however, observed mild drama ensued when a suspected scavenger who tried to steal parts of the truck, was apprehended by the crowd who handed him over to the police.
This latest explosion is coming a month after a similar tanker explosion occurred along the Eleme axis of the same East-West Road, which claimed four lives and destroyed over 60 vehicles.

Exxon moves to smaller offices as it cuts back Nigeria operations,https://tribuneonlineng.com/exxon-moves-to-smaller-offices-as-it-cuts-back-nigeria-operations/,Tribune,"ExxonMobil is not renewing a 33-year-old lease on its expansive offices in Lagos’s upscale Lekki district which expires on Friday, three sources inside the company told Reuters, as it looks to scale down operations in Nigeria.
Exxon, Shell, TotalEnergies, and Eni have all sought to leave Nigeria’s oil-rich Niger Delta in recent years, citing security concerns, but such moves have been stalled by regulatory hurdles.
ExxonMobil’s plan to sell its land and shallow-water assets to local oil firm Seplat Energy (SEPLAT.LG), opens new tab, agreed in 2022, is nearing close as the local oil sector regulator told Reuters that an agreement signed on Wednesday between Nigerian state oil firm NNPC and Exxon’s local unit is a “precursor to regulatory approval”.
Exxon said it was maintaining a strong presence in Nigeria. “Our move to a new modern, purpose-built office reflects our commitment to Nigeria,” said Oge Udeagha, a spokesperson for ExxonMobil’s Nigerian unit. “We remain dedicated to our workforce and our staffing remains unchanged.”
Yet Exxon’s relocation to smaller offices and an absence of any new investments highlight how serious it is about scaling down its Nigerian operations, even as the country’s government turns on the charm for multinational oil firms.
Exxon is relocating staff from the 12-floor Mobil House, reportedly leased at the cost of $10 million annually, to a six-floor office building 22 kilometers away in the upmarket Ikoyi area, built to accommodate half the personnel working at the former offices.
“The new office leaves no one in doubt about its future plans for Nigeria,” a staff member of the company told Reuters.
Having agreed on the disposal to Seplat Energy, ExxonMobil has said it will focus on its deepwater assets in Nigeria, through its local units Esso Exploration and Production Nigeria and Esso Exploration and Production Nigeria (Deepwater).
Nigerian President Bola Tinubu, who took office last year, has made attracting investment a key priority and has directed that divestment deals be resolved as quickly as possible.

"I’ll vie for presidency as long as my health permits, says Atiku",https://tribuneonlineng.com/ill-vie-for-presidency-as-long-as-my-health-permits-says-atiku/,Tribune,"FORMER Vice President Atiku Abubakar has said he will not give up on his bid for the office of president in Nigeria as long as his health allows him.
The 77-year-old politician made the assertion during an interview on the Hausa service of the Voice of America (VOA) monitored in Abuja.
He also hinged his persistent bid on the trajectory of a former American President, the late Abraham Lincoln, who contested many times before he eventually emerged victorious.
“Of course, I will keep contesting again and again as long as I am alive and healthy,” the Peoples Democratic Party presidential candidate during the 2019 and 2023 presidential elections, declared.
“Even the former US President Abraham Lincoln contested seven times before finally winning.
“However, given the current state of the PDP, it is clear that a single-handed effort will not suffice to win the election. Strong support and collaboration with other parties are required,” Atiku said.
Atiku lost to former president, Muhammadu Buhari in 2019 and to Bola Tinubu in 2023.
Between 1999 and 2007, Atiku was vice president to former president, Olusegun Obasanjo.
Speaking on the Hausa service of the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) about two weeks ago, Atiku said he would be willing to back Mr Peter Obi in 2027 if the PDP decides that it is the turn of the South-East to produce the president of the country.
“I have said repeatedly and I even said it before the 2023 general election that if the PDP decides to zone the presidential ticket to the South or South-East specifically, I won’t contest it.
“As long as it is the decision of the party, I will abide by it. But I contested the 2023 presidential ticket because it was thrown open to all members of the party.
“If the party decides that it is the turn of the South-East and Peter Obi is chosen, I won’t hesitate to support him,” he said.
On his recent meeting with Obi, the 2023 candidate of the Labour Party, in the presidential poll, Atiku had stated: “It’s just a normal friendly meeting that we often have, particularly among us in the opposition parties. Such meetings are healthy for Nigeria’s democracy and in the country’s interest.”
On the possibility of the talks leading to the formation of an alliance, the former vice president declared: “Yes, it’s very much possible. We can merge to achieve a common goal. So, it’s possible, and nothing can stop it if we wish to achieve that.”

"All CCTV cameras on campus switched off during abduction of university students, says Kogi gov",https://tribuneonlineng.com/all-cctv-cameras-on-campus-switched-off-during-abduction-of-university-students-says-kogi-gov/,Tribune,"GOVERNOR Usman Ododo of Kogi State on Saturday expressed determination to rescue the nine abducted students of Confluence University of Science and Technology (CUSTEC), Osara, from their abductors.
He, however, disclosed that investigation so far indicated that in spite of installed CCTV cameras in all the classrooms and the entire perimeter of the university campus, all the cameras were switched off when the abductors struck.
The governor made this known when he visited the university campus on an assessment of the security situation in the wake of the security breach on the campus that led to the abduction of the students.
Bandits had invaded the institution Thursday night and abducted nine students, whose whereabouts still remained unknown and the kidnappers yet to make contact with the management of the institution.
Ododo, who was taken round by the Vice Chancellor, Professor Abdulraman Asipita, vowed to secure the safe return of the students from their abductors.
“This visit is part of my concern for what happened on Thursday and to assure parents and management that every necessary step including non-kinetic measures have been activated to ensure the safe return of the abducted students.
“I hereby wish to assure members of the university community of the efforts of my administration to improve the existing security architecture on the campus.
“We will do whatever it takes to return all the abducted students to the university and to reunite them with their families and friends.
“It is our duty as a government to protect lives and property in all parts of the state. We are prepared to protect the students and that is why we allowed the students to stay on the campus.
“It’s unfortunate that in spite of installed CCTV cameras in all the classrooms and the entire perimeter of the university campus, the abductors still struck.
“Our investigation so far revealed that all the cameras were switched off and this can only be attributed to sabotage by internal collaborators,” he lamented.
According to him, security agencies are on their heels and investigation is ongoing to ensure that the perpetrators are brought to book.
He disclosed that there would be regular review of the operation as more facts emerge from the investigation.
“I am here to see things myself; to assess the situation and also to review the ongoing operation that will ensure the safe return of the students to the school. What is most important now is how to rescue our students unhurt.
“We have the right information at our disposal but we can’t put all that out in the media. I want the parents and students to be calm as we are making concerted effort to secure the return of the students,” he said.
Ododo commended the security agencies for their gallantry in minimizing the impact of the attack by preventing the attackers from gaining access to the university hostels.
“Nothing will be spared to bring back the students and to prevent a repeat of such unfortunate attack on the university campus and elsewhere in the state, ”Ododo assured.

Court stops pro-Wike lawmakers from holding meetings,https://tribuneonlineng.com/court-stops-pro-wike-lawmakers-from-holding-meetings/,Tribune,"A Rivers State High Court sitting in Port Harcourt has barred members of the Rivers State House of Assembly, including its Speaker, all of whom are loyalists of the Minister of the Federal Capital Territory, Mr. Nyesom Wike, from parading themselves as members of the Assembly.
Justice Charles Nwali, who gave the interim order on Friday in a motion ex-parte brought before him, also gave an order restraining the defendants from dealing with, interfacing, accepting any resolutions, bills as members of the House of Assembly pending the hearing and determination of the motion on notice.
In the suit number PHC/1512/CS/2024, filed by Mr. Victor Oko Jumbo (Speaker, Rivers State House of Assembly); Sokari Goodboy, Orubienimigha Timothy, as members of the Assembly, asked the court to restrain the defendants from parading themselves as members of the House of Assembly, since their seats had been declared vacant with effect from December 13, 2023.
After hearing from Sammie A. Somiari (SAN) with B. N. Owunabo, K. O. Ogunjobi and others for the claimants/applicants, entered that Amaewhule and the others should stop acting as members of the Rivers State House of Assembly.
Amaewhule and 24 of his colleagues had defected from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), on which platform they were elected to the Assembly to the All Progressives Congress (APC).
In addition, Justice Wali also ordered that the Rivers State government should stop dealing with the affected lawmakers since their seats were vacant after they defected from the PDP that nominated them for election.
Justice Wali Said: It is hereby ordered as follows: “An Order of interim injunction is granted restraining the 1 to 25th Defendants from parading and holding out themselves as members of Rivers State House of Assembly and/ or meeting/sitting at the Auditorium of the House of Assembly Quarters located at off Aba Road, Port Harcourt or any other place whatsoever to purport to carry out the legislative business of the Rivers State House of Assembly, their legislative seats having been declared vacant pending the hearing and determination of the Motion on Notice.
“An Order of interim injunction is hereby made restraining the 26th to 28th Defendants from dealing with, interfacing, accepting any resolutions, bills and/or howsoever interacting with the 1 to 25th Defendants in their purported capacities as members of the Rivers State House of Assembly, their legislative seats having been declared vacant with effect from 13th December, 2023 pending the hearing and determination of the Motion on Notice.
“It is further ordered that this order, the Motion on Notice and the writ and other processes in this case be served on the 1 to 25th Defendants/Respondents within seven (7) days from date by substituted means to wit: by pasting at the entrance gate of the Rivers State House of Assembly Legislative Quarters, Off Aba Road, Port Harcourt and for such service to be deemed good and proper.
“That this case is adjourned to the 29th May, 2024 for Motion on Notice.”
APC speaks on status of defected legislators
Meanwhile, the All Progressives Congress (APC) has reacted to the plot to impeach embattled governor of Rivers State, Mr. Siminalayi Fubara, by members of the state House of Assembly.
Addressing journalists at the APC national secretariat in Abuja, on Friday, National Publicity Secretary of the party, Mr. Felix Morka, said that the 27 lawmakers, who defected to the APC, remained legitimate members of the House of Assembly.
Morka said the stance of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and the Governor Fubara that, having defected to the APC the 27 lawmakers have ceased to be members of the Assembly, was a wrong interpretation of Section 109 of the 1999 constitution.
He said: “If his declaration that the House of Assembly is nonexistent is based on the fact that the 27 members, who defected from PDP to APC, have lost their seats, then Governor Fubara is sorely misled.
“To be clear, the 27 Assembly members did not lose their membership of the Assembly by virtue of their defection. There is nothing homeostatic about Section 109(1)(g) of the constitution. It is not self-executing. The proviso to the said Section 109(1) (g) established exceptional grounds to the applicability of Section 109(1)(g)
“Section 109(1) states: A member of a House of Assembly shall vacate his seat in the House if (S.109(1)(g) – being a person whose election to the House of Assembly was sponsored by a political party, he becomes a member of another political party before expiration of the period for which that House was elected: Provided that his membership of the latter political party is not as a result of a division in the political party of which he was previously a member or of a merger of two or more political parties or factions by one of which he was previously sponsored.”
Morka maintained that “only a properly constituted court of law can make a determination as to whether a member of the House of Assembly has vacated his seat in accordance with that provision of the constitution. As no such judicial determination has been made, the 27 APC members of the House of Assembly remain the constitutionally recognised and authorised members of the Rivers State House of Assembly.
“The governor’s declaration flies in the face of a matter pending in court as instituted by some elders of the state on the very question of the legal status of the 27 members that defected from PDP to APC.  The court ruled that the plaintiffs in the matter lacked necessary locus standi to bring the action. An appeal against that ruling remains pending in the Court of Appeal. Governor Fubara is a party to that suit. And there is the subsisting order of injunction issued by a Federal High Court restraining the governor and his agents from impeding or frustrating the House of Assembly under the leadership of the Speaker, Martin Amaewhule.
“The governor’s attack on the House of Assembly and its leadership is in flagrant disrespect of the order of a court of law and a violent violation of the express provisions of the Constitution. His demolition of the Rivers State House of Assembly complex remains one of the most brazen attacks on democratic institutions in our nation’s history. And there is now grave apprehension that he may be spoiling to demolish the House of Assembly residential quarters in Port Harcourt, built only two years ago, following his recent Gestapo-like invasion of the Assembly quarters.”
“Governor Fubara’s weaponization of demolition of public assets as a strategy to dislodge and punish legitimate members of the legislature is nothing short of petty despotism and must be roundly condemned.
“Governor Fubara continues to conduct the business of government unhinged, and in total contempt of the state legislature. The governor expends the state’s resources without regard to appropriation and public procurement laws. The governor has unlawfully withheld local government funds as a punitive measure against perceived opponents, and only recently, directed that all heads and officials of the 23 local government areas should ignore the summons of the House of Assembly as he threatened to sack officials who flouted his directive.
“The power of the purse resides in the legislature. If, indeed, the House of Assembly does not exist, as Governor Fubara has declared, then the governor must necessarily shut down the entire government of Rivers State, especially the office of the governor, as he lacks the authority to expend public resources without valid appropriations by the legislature.
“Governor Fubara cannot abrogate the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. He cannot be governor and be despot-in-chief of the Rivers State House of Assembly, at the same time. Attempting to impose an illegal three-man House of Assembly is executive lawlessness in the extreme. Governor Fubara’s quest to repudiate the Constitution and govern in denial of the existence of the state legislature is, in and of itself, among other grounds, an impeachable offense.
“We strongly counsel Governor Fubara to submit himself to the dictates of the constitution and the rule of law. In any and all contests between Governor Fubara and the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, the constitution shall prevail, always. The good people of Rivers State deserve so much more than the seemingly unending chicanery of Governor Fubara.”

"Even if my arrest order was issued in error, you must appear in court, Judge tells Ex-Gov Yahaya Bello",https://tribuneonlineng.com/even-if-my-arrest-order-was-issued-in-error-you-must-appear-in-court-judge-tells-ex-gov-yahaya-bello/,Tribune,"Justice  Emeka Nwite of the Federal High Court, Abuja, on Friday, granted the application by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) for the former Governor of Kogi, Alhaji Yahaya Bello, to appear in court to take his plea before any of his application can be heard.
Nwite reiterated in a ruling that an applicant or defendant who willfully disobeys the orders of a court of competent jurisdiction is not entitled to be heard by the court.
The judge while holding that, even if his orders were issued in error, “the humble thing for him to do is to make himself available in court”.
It would be recalled that the court had, in a ruling on April 23, ordered the service of the charge containing money laundering allegations against Bello, on his lawyer, AbdulWahab Mohammed (SAN) on grounds that the lawyer, having appeared for him in the last proceedings, is a proper person to receive the charge on behalf of the former governor.
Shortly after Mohammed accepted service, EFCC’s lawyer, Dr Kemi Pinheiro (SAN) called for the arraignment of Bello, but was opposed by Bello’s lawyer who prayed the court to discountenance the request, adding that the arrest warrant must first be set aside before arraignment.
According to Mr Adeola Adedipe (SAN), when the court granted the exparte, the charge has not been served, adding that the court ought to, on its own vacate the warrant order, following the service of the charge.
“The court must satisfy itself that the defendant (Bello) will not be prejudiced in fairness if the warrant of arrest continues to hang on his neck, having been made before service of the charge contrary to Section 394 of ACJA,” Adeola argued and added that justice should be a three-way traffic; that is, justice to the prosecution, the defendant and the public.
He said for Bello to appear in court, he must have the notion that he would get justice.
Adedipe also argued that the EFCC was an unconstitutional body because its establishment was not ratified by the 36 states of the federation.
He said that for the EFCC to become a constitutional body, the 36 states of the federation must ratify the law establishing it as against the current position, that the EFCC Establishment Act was unilaterally ratified by the Federal Government.
He therefore asked the judge to vacate the arrest warrant against the former governor.
But, Pinheiro opposed the application and added that before the arrest warrant can be vacated, the former governor must be arraigned and his plea taken in compliance with Section 396 (2) of the Administration of Criminal Justice Act (ACJA), 2015.
After taking submissions from parties Justice Nwite fixed May 10, for ruling.
Delivering the ruling, the judge agreed with the argument of the EFCC and held that the order of the court subsists until it is set aside, even if there is irregularity.
The judge said Yahaya Bello’s staying away amounted to disregard to the sanctity of the court, saying, “Therefore, the application by the counsel for the defendant cannot be moved unless the defendant is present in court. Bello should come to court on his own not through EFCC for arraignment on the next adjourn date”.
Meanwhile, shortly after the ruling, Mohammed, who appeared for the former governor, informed the court of a motion on notice filed on May 9, praying the court to stay further hearing of the alleged money laundering charge filed against Bello until the Court of Appeal decides a pending case relating to same matter.
The senior lawyer said the anti-graft agency had, by a motion ex-parte, got an order of the Appeal Court stopping the contempt proceedings filed by the ex-governor against the agency at the High Court sitting in Lokoja.
He said the appellate court had already fixed May 20 to hear the case and that, it would be important  for the Federal High Court, Abuja to await the outcome before going further with the trial.
But the EFCC’s lawyer, Oyedepo, disagreed with Mohammed’s submission.
In a short ruling, Justice Nwite refused Mohammed’s application, saying that the matter had generated unnecessary controversy.
But Mohammed responded that the former governor was not afraid to come to court but was only afraid your his life.
Justice Nwite, however, said that Bello should not be misguided but should be advised to come and answer to the alleged charge.
“It is just a charge. It has not been proven. Counsel, it is your duty to bring him and you prepare yourselves,” he said.
“We thank lordship. We will take your admonition to him because that is just his fear,” Mohammed said, adding that provided his client would not be abducted by the anti-graft agency, he assured that efforts would be made to contact the ex-governor to appear in court in the next adjourned date.
Justice Nwite consequently adjourned the matter till June 13, 2024 for arraignment.

"Ondo APC primary: How Ododo, Omo-Agege changed collation centre without prior notice, Jimoh Ibrahim alleges",https://tribuneonlineng.com/ondo-apc-primary-how-ododo-omo-agege-changed-collation-centre-without-prior-notice-jimoh-ibrahim-alleges/,Tribune,"Senator Jimoh Ibrahim on Tuesday took his protest over the outcome of the April 20 Ondo State governorship primaries of the All Progressives Congress (APC) to the National Assembly in Abuja.
This time round, Ibrahim made fresh allegations against Kogi State governor, Mr Usman Ododo, and a former Deputy President of the Senate, Senator Ovie Omo-Agege, whom he accused of changing the venue of the state collation centre without giving contestants and other stakeholders prior notice.
Ododo and Omo-Agege were the chairman and secretary respectively of the election committee sent by the APC to conduct the primaries.
He maintained his stance of seeking a repeat of the governorship primaries on the grounds that election was not conducted in 15 out of the 18 local government areas in the state.
Ibrahim, who represents Ondo-South Senatorial District at the Senate, alleged that the outcome of the election was manipulated in favour of the governor of the State, Mr Lucky Aiyedatiwa.
Speaking with Senate Correspondents at the National Assembly, Ibrahim, who was a contestant in the primaries, accused the APC’s electoral committee chaired by Ododo, of allocating votes, as against conducting genuine polls
It was mere allocation of figures, no election. I was not even able to vote”, he said.
Ibrahim called for a repeat of the primaries or in the alternative, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) should bar the APC from participating in the main election.
Ibrahim, who brandished a document he said was the certified true copy of INEC’s report on the election, claimed that the primaries didn’t take place in up to 127 wards in the state, including Ilaje, the local government of the governor.
He recalled how he informed the National Chairman of the APC, Alhaji Abdullahi Gaduje, of his predicament, whereupon Ganduje directed that the election team should be sent to his house just so that he could vote.
He disclosed that when the team arrived at his house, he sent the members away “because my house was not a designated voting area”, adding that the development was a pointer to the fact that internal democracy hardly thrived in the country.
“We will fight to the Supreme Court.
“In 127 of the wards, there was no election. Results were merely allocated. ..15 out of 18 local governments, no election, meaning that in 80% of the state, there was no voting”, he added.

Chagoury: President’s son not disqualified from doing business —Presidency,https://tribuneonlineng.com/chagoury-presidents-son-not-disqualified-from-doing-business-presidency/,Tribune,"The Presidency has responded to the statement attributed to former vice president Atiku Abubakar, questioning the membership of President Bola Tinubu’s son, Seyi, on the board of companies owned by Gilbert Chagoury.
Atiku in a statement on Sunday had claimed that the development amounted to conflict of interest.
The former vice president, in a statement signed by his Media Adviser, Paul Ibe, affirmed that Seyi is a director on the board of CDK Integrated Industries, a subsidiary of the Chagoury Group, which manufactures ceramic tiles and sanitary towels.
In the statement, Atiku cited a report by Paris-based Africa Intelligence News Agency, where it was revealed by the Corporate Affairs Commission that the president’s son is officially a business associate of Chagoury.
He said it was not surprising that the Chagoury Group had become the biggest beneficiary of the Tinubu largesse.
Atiku further restated that it has become obvious even to the undiscerning that the Lagos-Calabar Coastal Highway is being done in a hurry purely because of the business relationship between Tinubu and Gilbert Chagoury, the owner of Hi-tech, the contractor that was awarded the contract for the highway project allegedly in contravention of the procurement laws.
However, a statement issued by Bayo Onanuga, Special Adviser to the president on Information and Strategy on Monday, maintained that Seyi as a 38-year-old adult, has the right to do business anywhere in the country, noting that being the son of the president should not disqualify him.
The statement said: “It is important to state clearly that Seyi Tinubu is a 38-year-old adult who has a right to do business and pursue his business interests in Nigeria and anywhere in the world within the limits of the law. The fact that his father is now the President of Nigeria does not disqualify Seyi from pursuing legitimate business interests.
“For the records, Seyi joined the Board of Directors of CDK in 2018, more than six years ago. He is representing the interest of an investor company, in which he has interest.
“He is not a board member because his father is a friend of the Chagourys.
“Information about owners and shareholders of CDK is a matter of public record that can be openly accessed from the website of the Corporate Affairs Commission and CDK’s.
“Atiku and his proxy did not need a little-known journal to recycle open-source information to make a fallacious argument.
“The Chairman of CDK and the highest shareholder of the company is respected General TY Danjuma (rtd).
“The Chagourys are minority shareholders in the company, and only one member of the clan is on its five-man board.
“We wonder how Seyi’s membership of the board of CDK conflicts with Hi-tech Construction Company’s work on Lagos-Calabar Coastal superhighway.”
The presidency accused Atiku of being the one who breached extant public service when he set up Intels Company while serving as a Customs officer.
The statement added: “We found it strange that Alhaji Atiku could accuse President Tinubu of conflict of interest in the award of Lagos-Calabar Coastal highway to Hi-tech Construction Company which he claimed is owned by Chagoury family because the President’s son, Seyi Tinubu, sits on the board of CDK, a tiles manufacturing company, based in Sagamu, Ogun State.
“Nigerians should, by now, be well accustomed to Atiku’s hypocrisy on many national issues.
“Is it not amusing that the former Vice President, a man who openly said he formed Intels Nigeria with an Italian businessman when he was serving in the Nigeria Customs Service, a clear breach of extant public service regulations, is now the one accusing someone else of conflict of interest?
The statement said that contrary to Atiku’s claim, the Tinubu administration, within its first year, has attracted over $20 billion into the economy.
According to the presidency, while President Tinubu was in New Delhi, India for G20 Summit last year August, Indian business leaders committed over $14 billion in new investments.
It said a substantial part of this sum is already in the country.
The statement added: “In an unmistakable vote of confidence in the economic reforms being executed by the Tinubu administration, foreign investment in Nigeria’s stock market has ballooned, from N18.12 billion in Q1 2023 to N93.37 billion in Q1 2024, an increase of 415%.
“The last time Nigeria saw such level of investment was in the first quarter of 2019, when N97.6 billion was invested. The market, since Tinubu came to power, has broken records and created more wealth for the investors.
“During President Tinubu’s recent trip to The Netherlands, the Prime Minister, Mark Rutte, announced a fresh $ 250 million investment by Dutch businesses in Nigeria.
“Different sectors of the economy, especially telecoms, manufacturing, solid minerals, oil and gas, e-commerce, and fintech, are attracting new Foreign Direct Investments from discerning investors who know Nigeria is a good market for bountiful returns.”
It alleged that Atiku has been waging an unrelenting war against this all-important and transformative project for no justifiable reasons other than bad politics.
The statement further said: “Atiku knows that its grand success and other projects to be unfurled, such as the Badagry-Sokoto superhighway, will be a major boost for President Tinubu and finally upend his perennial presidential ambition.
“If not blinded by political ill-will, Alhaji Atiku knows that the right thing for him to do is to applaud President Tinubu for the ambitious and audacious Lagos-Calabar Highway, which was authorised by the Federal Executive Council.”
“It is important to remind Alhaji Atiku that infrastructural projects such as the Lagos-Calabar Coastal Highway are used to galvanise the economy. In the US, President Joe Biden has used his $2 trillion bi-partisan infrastructure deal to revamp decaying American infrastructure and inject life into the US economy.
“How can an elder statesman be waging a campaign of calumny against the economic fortunes and prosperity of a country he wishes to govern or trying to scuttle a project that will bring prosperity to nine coastal states and the nation in general?
“That Nigeria’s economy is being reclassified by the IMF as the fourth largest in Africa is stale news. This happened because of the devaluation of the Naira and President Tinubu’s determined effort to set the economy on the path of sustainable growth. Under the progressive, bold, inventive, and innovative leadership of President Tinubu, Nigeria will bounce back to where it rightfully belongs as Africa’s largest market and biggest economy.
“The Tinubu administration targets a $1 trillion economy in the next few years, with audacious economic programmes and critical infrastructure projects in key sectors. With revenue rising in trillions and the creation of the Renewed Hope Infrastructure Fund, which is poised to raise over N20 trillion this year alone, we have no doubt that the $1 trillion economy is realisable.”

On June 3, his former assistant, Lauren Pisciotta, filed a lawsuit against him, alleging sexual harassment and wrongful termination of their working contract.
Pisciotta, who worked for West for two years, alleges that he sent her sexually explicit texts and behaved inappropriately during her tenure. West has not yet publicly responded to the allegations.
According to the filing, obtained by The Blast, Pisciotta has 15 years of experience in the music industry. West hired her as a creative collaborator on his Yeezy Season 1 women’s fashion line in 2015 and she also worked on his 2021 album, Donda

In July 2021, she was appointed as West's Executive Assistant/Personal Assistant with a promised salary of $1 million per year, requiring her to be available ""24/7.""
Pisciotta revealed that prior to her full-time role with West, she earned $1 million creating content on OnlyFans and social media. Initially, West was supportive, referring to her as an ""OnlyFans superstar,"" but in August 2022, he demanded she delete her OnlyFans account and become ""God-like,"" promising to pay her $1 million.
She claimed he never paid and began sexually harassing her, sending explicit messages and pornographic videos, and masturbating during phone calls.
The lawsuit further alleges that on a flight to Paris, West called Pisciotta into a private room and masturbated under the covers. In September 2022, Pisciotta was promoted to chief of staff for West’s companies with a promised $3 million bonus, but the next month, she was offered a $3 million severance package, which she also never received. She claims West developed an “obsession” with her, moving into her building and “stalking” her after her termination.
Pisciotta is suing for at least $4 million, citing breach of contract, a hostile work environment, and sexual harassment.

New autopsy reveals drug reaction as possible cause of Mohbad's death,https://www.pulse.ng/entertainment/celebrities/new-autopsy-reveals-drug-reaction-as-possible-cause-of-mohbads-death/jhzhsmm,Pulse,"New autopsy results have speculated that Nigerian singer Ilerioluwa 'Mohbad' Aloba, may have died from a possible drug reaction.


According to the report obtained by TheCable on June 6, 2024, there were speculation about a potential drug reaction based on limited post-mortem and toxicology findings. Despite this, the exact cause of the singer's death remains unknown.
According to the report, various samples were taken for toxicology testing, including gastric content, blood, bone marrow, liver, kidney, and lung. However, the toxicology results did reveal the presence of Diphenhydramine, an anti-histamine, but the concentration detected was not deemed fatal or lethal.
Antihistamines like diphenhydramine are usually used to treat allergies, stomach ailments, cold symptoms, and anxiety.
Furthermore, the anatomical and pathological examination also showed an injury on Mohbad’s right forearm, and his body was found to be moderately to severely decomposed upon exhumation.
Mohbad passed away on September 12, 2023 and after investigations, the police determined that the singer was administered injections by a quack nurse named Feyisayo Ogedengbe. Said injections, consisting of tetanus toxoid, paracetamol, and an antibiotic known as Cetrazone triggered an immediate reaction, including vomiting, goosebumps and convulsions, after which he passed.
Shortly after his passing, Nigerians began to clamour for an investigation into his death, considering its sudden nature.

In a lawsuit filed in Los Angeles, Mangroe accuses The-Dream of rape, sexual battery, and sex trafficking, painting a picture of a manipulative and abusive relationship that began under the pretext of advancing her music career.


Mangroe claims that in 2015, The-Dream lured her with promises of stardom, only to subject her to repeated sexual assaults, physical abuse, and emotional manipulation. According to the lawsuit, he pressured her into unwanted sex, sometimes using threats and coercion, including recording an intimate encounter and threatening to share the footage. Mangroe describes a pattern of control and abuse, including being locked in a dark room, being forced to have sex in public spaces, and enduring threats with a gun placed beside her during encounters​​.
The-Dream, a highly influential figure in the music industry, is known for his work with top artists like Beyoncé, Rihanna, and Mariah Carey. His contributions to hits like ""Umbrella,"" ""Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It),"" and ""Break My Soul"" have cemented his reputation as a prolific producer and songwriter. Despite his professional success, these allegations have cast a dark shadow over his career​​.
In response to the allegations, The-Dream has vehemently denied any wrongdoing, calling the claims ""untrue and defamatory."" He expressed deep offence and sadness over the accusations, asserting his commitment to helping others achieve their career goals without harassment.
Mangroe's lawsuit also accuses The-Dream of sex trafficking, a claim seen in other high-profile cases, including those against Sean Combs. This case highlights ongoing issues within the music industry, where power dynamics can lead to exploitation and abuse. Mangroe, represented by Douglas H. Wigdor and Meredith A. Firetog, hopes that her story will help others and prevent future abuse​​.
As the case progresses, it underscores the need for greater scrutiny and accountability in the entertainment industry, particularly regarding the treatment of women and aspiring artists. The lawsuit serves as a reminder of the dark realities that can lurk behind the glitz and glamour of the music business.

I wasn't shading Wizkid with my comment - Ladipoe clarifies social media controversy,https://www.pulse.ng/entertainment/music/ladipoe-reacts-to-the-allegation-that-he-sha5ded-wizkid/w9h1pg8,Pulse,"In an interview with Cool FM, award-winning rapper Ladipoe addressed the recent allegations of shading Wizkid on X (formerly Twitter).


According to Ladipoe, he was only joking and he never meant to disrespect Wizkid with his comments on Afrobeats. Ladipoe stated that he was only commenting on the ongoing conversation about the state of Afrobeats which is coming after a period where hip hop was falsely adjudged to be dying.
""The whole p was a joke...hip hop artists have been through this time where there was this false narrative that hip hop is dead...now Afrobeats is seeing the same whispers. So my comment was like 'So Afrobeats guys are going through what hip hop went through but this too shall pass,'""Ladipoe told Cool FM.
His comment will be misconstrued to be targeted at Wizkid who had been criticised for saying hip hop was dead and for later also dissociating with Afrobeats.
During the interview, Ladipoe further clarified that his comments were aimed and the audience rather than at any artist.
""If there was anybody it was aimed at, it was the audience or anyone who believed this false narrative. You can't say any genre is dead as long as they are artists alive and there are people wanting the music"" Ladipoe stated.
Wizkid reacted to Ladipoe's comment by saying that he can't respond to any rapper sign to an influencer in what was a jab at Mavin Records boss Don Jazzy.
Wizkid comments would further fuel the issue with fans and observers scolding the Grammy winner for reducing Don Jazzy's status to just an influencer.

In an interview with Vanity Fair, the award-winning actress spoke on the significant shift she experienced in her religious beliefs after moving to New York.
Like many people with immigrant parents in America, she was said she was raised in a strict and religious home. Her mother attended a pentecostal church.
She said the church laid emphasis on modesty and gave no room for jewellery, skin showing, or form-fitting outfits. The church also preached on the second coming of Jesus, which she said increased her anxiety.
“It was horrible for my anxiety, I was petrified of death. I was petrified of the rapture,” she said.
Edebiri also struggled with the idea that her gay and muslim friends wouldn't make heaven, which was the teaching she got in church. “It was genuinely breaking my brain and giving me so much stress and sadness. I was just like, ‘I need a break,'"" she told the outlet.
Because of that, she sought a break from the church and its preaching, and aside from occasionally following her parents to church she is still on said break.
Since stepping into the spotlight as an actress, Edebiri has become a force to be reckoned with in Hollywood. She has now clinched a Golden Globe, a Critics Choice Award and an Emmy Award for her role in the hit series The Bear."

In the post believed to be directed at Nigerian consumers, Awoniyi said ""We are not here to entertain you. You only happened to be entertained.""
Tems' manager who has been vocal about his Christian faith then proceeded to say that with or without their opinions, observers will sit and watch and behold the work of a perfect God.

President Tinubu is officially my GOAT - Brymo on national anthem change,https://www.pulse.ng/entertainment/celebrities/president-tinubu-is-officially-my-goat-brymo-on-national-anthem-change/qhnrg1k,Pulse,"Following the change in the National anthem, singer Brymo has declared President Tinubu as his Greatest Of All Time (G.O.A.T) among all the previous presidents.


The controversial singer made this declaration in an Instagram Story post on May 30, 2024. He posted the lyrics of the new national anthem, emphasising on the first stanza and likening Africa and Nigeria to ""polygamy"" and a ""family unit.""
He said, ""President Bola Ahmed Tinubu is officially my G.O.A.T of all the Nigerian presidents! Read the lyrics of the new national anthem. The first stanza is all you need; it asserts Nigeria for the motherland and now Africa can be the fatherland and be a symbol of polygamy and we can all focus on one family unit. My favourite part is 'In brotherhood, we stand.' We are all now members of the greatest cult on earth. Nigeria is now the only brotherhood that every boy and ambitious girl must belong to in this country. I am very happy.""
Recall that the Senate and the House of Representatives recently approved the legislation to change the national anthem from “Arise, O Compatriots” to “Nigeria, We Hail Thee.” Shortly after that, on May 29, 2024, President Tinubu signed the bill into law, officially changing the national anthem.
Senate President Godswill Akpabio announced this on Wednesday, May 29, during a joint session of the National Assembly, which also marked the 25th anniversary of Nigeria’s 4th Republic.
The change led to a series of reactions from Nigerians across social media platforms, ranging from confusion, anger, frustration and for people like Brymo, happiness. Nigerian celebrities also voiced their feelings about the swift reversion to the previous national anthem.
It is worthy of note that “Nigeria, We Hail Thee,” was written by Lillian Jean Williams, a British expatriate who resided in Nigeria during its independence era, while Frances Berda composed the music. However ""Arise O Compatriots,' was written by Pa Benedict Odiase, a Nigerian composer, and it was adopted in 1978.

Strike: Ajaero Speaks From Geneva,https://dailytrust.com/strike-ajaero-speaks-from-geneva/,DailyTrust,"President of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), Joe Ajaero, has spoken on the next line of action of the organised Labour regarding minimum wage.
Organised labour had paralysed activities across the country exactly a week ago over the failure of Federal Government to comply with its demand.
However, the strike was suspended for a week after government pleaded for time to consider the demand.
President Bola Tinubu had asked Finance Minister, Wale Edun, to submit a template on minimum wage payment.
While Labour reduced its demand to N250,000 from N494,000, the Federal Government offered N62,000.
The Nigerian Governors’ Forum had later said N60,000 was too much in light of the economic realities.
The one-week suspension of the strike would elapse on Tuesday, making Nigerians confused over the next line of action.
But in an interview with select journalists at Geneva, Switzerland, where International Labour Conference is ongoing, Ajaero said reports of the tripartite committee has been submitted to President Bola Tinubu.
Ajaero said the organised labour could not embark on strike on Tuesday because it would have to wait for the president to consider the figures submitted by the tripartite committee on minimum wage before further action could be taken.
The labour leader explained that the submission of N62,000 as proposed by the government and members of the organised private sector, with labour proposing N250,000 does not translate to labour accepting N62,000 as the new minimum wage.
“The tripartite committee submitted two figures to the President. Government and employers proposed N62,000 while labour proposed N250,000. We are waiting for the decision of the President.
“Our National Executive Council (NEC) will deliberate on the new figure when it is out. We cannot declare strike now because the figures are with the President. We will wait for the President’s decision.
“During the tenure of the immediate-past President, the figure that was proposed to him was N27,000 by the tripartite committee but he increased it to N30,000.
“We are hopeful that this President will do the right thing. The President had noted that the difference between N62,000 and N250,000 is a wide gulf,” he told journalists during the interview.
Ajaero also lampooned the state governors under the umbrella body of the Nigerian Governors’ Forum for rejecting the N62,000 minimum wage proposal.
He stated, “How can any governor say he cannot pay? They cannot also be calling for the decentralization of the minimum wage. Are there wages decentralized?
“Governors whose states are not contributing a dime to the national purse and who generate pitiable Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) are collecting the same amount as governors whose states are generating billions of dollars into the FAAC.
“They should decentralize their salaries and emoluments first. So, where is the governor of Edo state, Godwin Obaseki getting his money from? He is paying N70,000 minimum wage. This is the type of governor that should be emulated and not the lazy ones.”

"Legal Issues As FCT Gets Civil Service Commission, Others",https://dailytrust.com/legal-issues-as-fct-gets-civil-service-commission-others/,DailyTrust,"There have been some legal conundrums on the status of the Federal Capital Territory following some recent executive and judicial pronouncements relating to the FCT.
Natives of the FCT and observers have called for legislative action to recognise the territory as a state with equal governance organs – executive and legislature – following the latest pronouncements by the highest courts of the land and the moves to incorporate its civil service commission.
The Minister of the FCT, Nyesom Wike, on March 4, announced plans to appoint permanent secretaries in the ministries under the territory alongside the Civil Service Commission.
Wike, who stated this during a meeting with the directors of the Federal Capital Development Authority (FCDA) on Monday, said the commission would appoint nine permanent secretaries to oversee the secretariats.
The secretariats are Agriculture and Rural Development, Transport and Economic Planning, Revenue Generation and Public Private Partnerships.
The others are Education, Social Development, Legal Services, Area Council, Health and Environment and Women Affairs.
The reforms are part of the Federal Capital Territory Service Commission (Establishment) Act, 2018 which provides that the commission would be established and charged with the responsibility for the appointment, discipline and transfer of the civil service of the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja.
Although the constitution provides that the FCT would be administered directly under the federal government and its other arms of government, the commission’s Act regulates the overall administration of the territory’s civil service.
The Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999, from Section 297 provides thus: “There shall be a Federal Capital Territory, Abuja the boundaries of which are as defined in Part II of the First Schedule to this Constitution.
2) The ownership of all lands comprised in the Federal Capital Territory; Abuja shall vest in the Government of the Federal Republic of Nigeria;
“298. The Federal Capital Territory, Abuja shall be the Capital of the Federation and seat of the Government of the Federation;
“299. The provisions of this Constitution shall apply to the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja as if it were one of the States of the Federation; and accordingly – (a) all the legislative powers, the executive powers and the judicial powers vested in the House of Assembly, the Governor of a State and in the courts of a State shall, respectively, vest in the National Assembly, the President of the Federation and in the courts which by virtue of the foregoing provisions are courts established for the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja; (b) all the powers referred to in paragraph (a) of this section shall be exercised in accordance with the provisions of this Constitution; and (c) the provisions of this Constitution pertaining to the matters aforesaid shall be read with such modifications and adaptations as may be reasonably necessary to bring them into conformity with the provisions of this section.”
In its judgement on the presidential election petitions of the 2023 election on September 6, 2023, the Presidential Election Petitions Court presided by Justice Haruna Tsammani held that the contention by both the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and the Labour Party (LP) that the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) did not score two-third votes in 24 states of the federation and the FCT as provided in Section 134(2)(b) of the Nigerian Constitution was “fallacious”.
 The panel said the provision of Section 134(2)(b) and Section 299 of the Nigerian Constitution intends that in calculating the two-thirds of the states of the federation, the FCT would be treated as though it were one of the states.
“If the candidate scores 25 per cent or a quarter of the votes of the 37 states of the federation, FCT inclusive, the presidential candidate shall be deemed to have been duly elected even if he fails to score 25 per cent of the votes in the FCT as the votes of the second respondent (Tinubu),” he said.
The verdict was affirmed by a seven-member panel of justices of the Supreme Court on October 26, 2023.  
An Abuja-based human rights lawyer, Hameed Ajibola Jimoh Esq., said the FCT is constitutionally entitled to have its civil service administration and or commission which is an administrative structures of the FCT and such operation of the administrative structures are belated.
He referred to sections 197; 198; 199; 200; 201; 202; 203; 204; 205; 206; 207 of the Constitution; and Part II (A) of the Third Schedule to the Nigerian Constitution of 1999.
“To that extent, FCT being declared to be a state by the constitution in sections 299 and 301, shall have such civil service and its commission and other state’s structures and institutions as may have been created for a state of the federation by the constitution.

Katsina Gov: Nigeria Must Embrace Ranching Than Open Grazing,https://dailytrust.com/katsina-gov-nigeria-must-embrace-ranching-than-open-grazing/,DailyTrust,"Governor Dikko Radda of Katsina State has called for a shift towards ranching as a more sustainable and profitable alternative to open grazing.
Recall that the bill seeking to ban open grazing and establish ranches for herders in the country has passed a second reading at the Senate.
The bill was passed on Wednesday during the plenary after a majority of the senators supported it when the Senate President, Godswill Akpabio, put it to vote.
Speaking during TVC’s Politics on Sunday, the governor emphasized the benefits of ranching.
“There is a need for us to encourage ranching. I’m not supporting or opposing, but I’m saying there is a need for us to embrace ranching because it is more profitable,” Radda said
According to him, ranching offers value addition and is more secured compared to open grazing, which often leads to conflicts.
Governor Radda stressed the importance of a gradual transition, advocating for sensitization and encouragement for people to adopt ranching practices.
“We can’t take the herders off the streets just in a very short time. We need to give time for people to be enlightened. There’ll be a lot of sensitization and encouragement for people to go into ranching because it is more profitable and more secure,” he explained.
Despite significant security issues, Governor Radda highlighted that a substantial portion of land in Katsina is still being actively farmed.
“I’m telling you, 90% of the lands in Katsina are being cultivated despite the insecurity. There has been production in many areas affected by insecurity,” he noted.
However, he acknowledged the vulnerability of farms located near forests, which are hard to reach and control.
On the issue of minimum wage, Governor Radda also discussed the financial constraints facing Katsina State, contrasting its economic situation with more affluent states like Lagos.
“My monthly allocation has not exceeded 10 billion Naira. When you look at the wage bill, pensions, and overhead costs, it takes over 50% of what we collect,” he said.
He pointed out the disparity in revenue generation between states, emphasizing the need for tailored economic policies.
“Lagos is making about 60 billion Naira a month, while Katsina makes about 1.5 billion. How can you compare a state earning 60 billion with one earning 1.5 billion? Even with all mechanisms in place, Katsina cannot collect 10% of what Lagos collects in taxes,” he argued.
Radda criticized the one-size-fits-all approach to minimum wage in Nigeria, suggesting that each state should set wages based on its economic capabilities.
“It is only in Nigeria that we have one single minimum wage for laborers across all states. In other countries, different states have different minimum wages based on sustainability and affordability.
“What is the need for the state government to agree to pay 100,000 Naira if they can’t implement it?” he said.

Gombe To Partner Morocco Firm On Dairy Project,https://dailytrust.com/gombe-to-partner-morocco-firm-on-dairy-project/,DailyTrust,"The Gombe State Government is set to partner with a Morocco-based company, COPAG Bladna, to unlock the full potential of its livestock resources towards a profitable dairy business.
This was contained in a statement issued Sunday by Ismaila Uba Misilli, the Director General of Press Affairs to Governor Muhammadu Inuwa Yahaya.
The statement indicated that the governor led a delegation to the largest dairy factory in Taroudant, Agadir, Morocco, as part of his investment mission.
Misilli said the governor expressed his government’s desire to facilitate setting up a similar venture on a smaller scale through a Public Private Partnership (PPP) involving the state government, COPAG and other private sector investors.
During the visit, Governor Yahaya emphasised the ongoing efforts by his administration to organise livestock cooperatives to meet the increasing demand for dairy products.
He added that plans were underway to build a state-of-the-art abattoir and cattle market “which will serve as a regional hub for livestock business activities and their value chains.
“The Wawa-Zange Grazing Reserve holds immense potential for milk collection and processing. Our goal is to introduce sustainably produced dairy products such as flavoured milk, butter, cheese and yoghurt modelled after COPAG’s successful approach.”
Earlier, COPAG’s President, Moulay M’hamed Loultiti, expressed his commitment to support the Gombe’s investment initiatives through technical support and other collaborative means.
He said, “COPAG has been dedicated to fostering efficient, profitable and value-creating agriculture. Our integrated strategy has strengthened our agricultural expertise, marketing capabilities and industrial skills, ensuring high customer satisfaction and loyalty.”

"Obaseki Dares Benin Palace, Insists On Group’s Ban",https://dailytrust.com/obaseki-dares-benin-palace-insists-on-groups-ban/,DailyTrust,"Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki, has insisted that the ban on Okaighele (community youth leaders) activities in seven local governments in Edo South Senatorial district is still in force.
Recall that the Oba of Benin Palace had on June 7, 2024, kicked against the action of the Edo State Government.
While addressing the Okaigheles who protested to Palace, Chief Osaro Idah, the Obazelu of Benin, who spoke on behalf of the monarch, had said Okaighele is not something that can be banned by fiat as they belong to the Benin ancestors.
According to the Palace, Okaighele represents a segment of the aged-long Benin traditional administrative structure.
“Okaighele didn’t start in this Century. As you have age grades, and senior sons, so we have them. When Odionwere (village head) is appointed by the Oba, Okaighele assist the Odionwere in the daily administration of the domain on daily basis.”
But reacting to the Palace’s comments, the Edo government said Okaighele and cultists pose the most severe threat to the security and stability of the state.
The Commissioner for Orientation and Communication, Chris Nehikhare, who spoke on behalf of the government said Okaighele’s was made in the interest of public safety.
He described the development as a move to curb the alarming rise in cult-related activities.
“The Edo State Security Council data has shown that these two groups (Okaigheles and cultists) pose the most severe threat to the security and stability of the State, resulting in the decision of the Council to place a total ban on the criminal groups”.
“While we respect the tradition and customs of our communities, it is important to note that the safety and security of our citizens must always come first”.
“Chief Osaro Idah, Obazalu of Benin’s contradictory statement does not change the gravity of the situation at hand, and we stand by our decision to enforce this ban on Okaigheles to protect the lives of our people.”
He warned that government would not allow any individual or organization no matter now highly placed to undermine the efforts of the State Security Council to protect the lives and property.
“We reiterate that the activities of cultists, Okaigheles and their sponsors remain banned in the State and we will spare no effort to ensure that those who flout the ban are made to face the full weight of the Law,” he said.

"Zulum Hands Over Power To Deputy, Embarks On Hajj Trip",https://dailytrust.com/zulum-hands-over-power-to-deputy-embarks-on-hajj-trip/,DailyTrust,"Governor Babagana Umara Zulum of Borno state has handed over power to his deputy, Umar Usman Kadafur, and embarked on a trip to Saudi Arabia for the 2024 Hajj exercise.
Daily Trust reports that Zulum joined 1,815 Borno pilgrims in Saudi Arabia.
During an emergency session on Friday, Speaker of the Borno House of Assembly, Rt Hon Abdulkareem Lawan, announced that the governor was on 28-day vacation.
According to the speaker, the deputy governor would be in charge of governance from 10th June to 8th July, 2024.
He noted that the formal notice was in compliance with provisions of section 190 (1) of the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.
He said the assembly’s approval would give the deputy governor full powers to handle the state’s affairs without resort to the governor.
This is the second time that governor Zulum would transfer power to Kadafur to act as governor.
The first was in April, 2021 when the governor went on 21-day vacation.
Daily Trust gathered that the governor joined the congregation of 1,815 Borno pilgrims in Saudi Arabia.
He joined the last flight of the 175 pilgrims, departed Maiduguri International Airport at exactly 2:35am and landed at Prince Mohammed bin Abduaziz International Airport, Madina, at 8:10am.
Zulum, also accompanied by some government officials and politicians, is expected to begin his main spiritual journey immediately after arriving in Makkah, where all the Borno State pilgrims are accommodated.
However, his visit to the holy land is trailed by reactions from the pilgrims and officials who are trying  to understand the motive behind his coming to Saudi Arabia this time around.
While pilgrims expressed hope for a strict and better welfare, the officials of the state pilgrims board said it’s going to be a tough job this time around.
“This man (Zulum) will not rest and would never allow us to rest. He will follow every detail and take charge of everything if he’s not convinced. You can see the pilgrims celebrating his coming but we know who’s coming. It is not going to be easy,” one of the pilgrims’ board officials, said.

"Ondo 2024: Women Demand APC, PDP’s Deputy Gov’s Slots",https://dailytrust.com/ondo-2024-women-demand-apc-pdps-deputy-govs-slots/,DailyTrust,"Ahead of the November 16 governorship election in Ondo State, a group of women has called on the two major political parties, the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), to nominate females as their deputy governorship candidates.
The women, meeting for the first time at the NUJ press centre in Akure, emphasized the need for gender representation in political appointments, particularly in the formation of the next cabinet of the state.
The meeting, themed “Agitation for Gender Balance and Inclusiveness in Governance,” focused on securing a fair share of political offices, both elective and non-elective, for women.
In a communiqué issued and signed by the convener, Adebimpe Adeniyi, the group called for more gender-sensitive and all-inclusive government policies and programs.
The communique read in part: “We must acknowledge that women have been nominated and elected as deputy governors in some states in Nigeria. In the South West, only Ondo State, which prides itself as the intellectual base of the region, is yet to provide an opportunity for a female deputy governor.”
“After extensive deliberation during the Inaugural Meeting, we have resolved and demanded the nomination of women as deputy governorship candidates of all participating political parties in the 2024 Governorship Election of Ondo State.”
Earlier, former commissioner for information in the state, Tola Awo, encouraged women in the state to acquire academic knowledge to qualify for elective and non-elective positions.
The women’s demands come shortly after a youth group, the Ondo State Youth Network (OSYN), demanded a youthful running mate under the age of 45.

"Ayanrinde, Son Of Ibadan Popular Lawyer, Bags Three Years Jail Term For Impersonating Lawyer, Fraud",https://thenigerialawyer.com/ayanrinde-son-of-ibadan-popular-lawyer-bags-three-years-jail-term-for-impersonating-lawyer-fraud/,TheNigeriaLawyer,"A young man, Abdulgafar Ayanrinde, who claimed to have dropped out of the University of Ibadan where he studied Law, has been sentenced to six years imprisonment for impersonating a legal practitioner and committing fraud.
Ayanrinde, aged 25, had been dragged before a Magistrate’s Court sitting in Osogbo, Osun State, by the Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps in the state and slammed with a two-count charge bordering on impersonation and fraud.
He was said to have impersonated a legal practitioner and duped a Point of Sales operator.
When Ayanrinde was arrested and paraded by the corps in Osogbo recently, he had revealed that he ventured into criminal acts to spite his father whom he claimed to be a prominent Senior Advocate of Nigeria in Ibadan, Oyo State.
He had disclosed that he dropped out of the university at 200 level (Faculty of Law), owing to lack of money.
He confessed to have paraded himself as a SAN and deceived unsuspecting litigants into hiring him.
The NSCDC prosecuting counsel, T. J. Ayayi, had informed the court, upon arraignment, that Ayarinde paraded himself as a lawyer at the premises of the Osun State High Court on May 22, 2023 and also defrauded a female PoS agent of the sum of N150,000 at INEC Area, Osogbo on May 18, this year.
Ayanrinde had also admitted to having presented himself as a SAN to dupe five unsuspecting members of the public of their hard earned money.
He also confessed to stealing an iPhone worth N450,000,00.
The charge had read, “That you Ayanrinde Abdulgafar on the 22nd day of May, 2023, at the Osun State High Court, Oke-Fia, Osogbo, Osun State, in the Osogbo Magisterial District, willfully represented yourself to one Abdulsalam Adbulhafeez Abiodun that you are a legal practitioner and did pretend that you are qualified to act as a legal practitioner, representation which you knew to be false and thereby committed an offence contrary to Section 22(1) of the Legal Practitioners Act, Cap L11, LFN 2004 and punishable under the same section.
“That you (defendant) on the 18th day of May, 2023, at INEC Area, Osogbo, Osun State, in the Osogbo Magisterial District, with intent to defraud, did obtain the sum of N150,000. 00 (One Hundred and Fifty Thousand Naira) from one Adeoye Iyanu Seun on the pretence that you would transfer the said sum to her Polaris Bank Account, a pretence which you knew to be false and thereby committed an offence contrary to Section 1(2) of the Advance Fee Fraud and Other Fraud Related Offences Act – Cap A6 L.F.N. 2004 and punishable under Section 1(3) of the same Act.”
Ayanrinde had pleaded guilty to the allegations.
He was not represented by any lawyer in court.
The prosecutor had urged the court to adjourn the matter in order for him to prepare for the presentation of facts in lieu of the defendant’s guilty-plea.
The presiding magistrate, M. A. Olatunji had adjourned for presentation of facts.
When the matter was mentioned for presentation of facts, the corps prosecutor had proved to the court that the defendant specialized in fraud, impersonation, stealing and obtaining money under false pretence.
However, Magistrate Olatunji found him guilty of the charges and convicted him accordingly.
Delivering her judgement, Olatunji sentenced Ayanrinde to three years imprisonment on first count charge and another three years on the second charge.
The magistrate further ordered the transfer of the sum of N150,000, being part of the proceeds of the crime from the convict’s bank account to one of the victims, Adeoye Iyanu Seun’s account while the Nigeria Correctional Service should provide facility and enabling environment for the academic advancement of the convict while in custody.
Reacting to the judgement in a statement issued on Wednesday by the corps Public Relations Officer, Kehinde Adeleke, the state NSCDC Commandant, Agboola Sunday called on parents and guardians to cater for their children and wards adequately.
He urged youths to embark on productive ventures that add value to their lives, rather than embarking on crimes and criminalities.

"Hunter Biden Guilty Of Felony Gun Charges, Faces 25 Years In Prison",https://thenigerialawyer.com/hunter-biden-guilty-of-felony-gun-charges-faces-25-years-in-prison/,TheNigeriaLawyer,"Hunter Biden became the first child of a sitting president to be convicted of a crime Tuesday after a federal jury found him guilty of lying about his drug use in order to buy a gun.
The panel of six men and six women deliberated for three hours across two days before convicting the 54-year-old of making a false statement in the purchase of a firearm, making a false statement related to information required to be kept by a federally licensed firearms dealer, and possession of a firearm by an unlawful user of or addict to a controlled substance.
Prosecutors from special counsel David Weiss’ office had argued President Biden’s son knowingly fibbed on a gun application form that he did not use controlled substances before walking out of a Wilmington shop with a Colt Cobra .38-caliber revolver on Oct. 12, 2018.
In fact, Hunter Biden was hooked on crack cocaine at the time, a fact he acknowledged in his own 2021 memoir — which prosecutors used as evidence against him.
The first son stared at the jury and made no visible reaction as the foreperson read the verdict. Hunter’s wife Melissa sat in the gallery behind him, next to her husband’s “sugar brother,” attorney Kevin Morris.
The first son faces up to 25 years behind bars — though a lighter sentence is much more likely since he has no prior convictions.
The verdict is not the end of the first son’s legal trouble.
He’s scheduled to face a case in Los Angeles federal court beginning Sept. 5 for allegedly evading $1.4 million in federal income tax for the years 2016 through 2019.
Prosecutors from special counsel David Weiss’ office used witness testimony, Hunter’s own communications, data taken from his infamous laptop and excerpts from his book “Beautiful Things” to prove that he was using crack around the time he bought the firearm.
Judge Maryellen Noreika had ruled before trial that prosecutors didn’t have to prove that Hunter was high the day he purchased the weapon.
Jurors heard a plethora of excerpts from the audiobook of Hunter’s memoir — narrated by the first son himself — describing his struggle with addiction and how he had a “superpower of finding crack cocaine anytime, anywhere.”
The jury also saw copious messages in which Hunter appeared to be pursuing drug deals and talked about being high or how he was using — including texting his dealer in the spring of 2018 asking: “Can you get baby powder, the real soft stuff.”
Jurors heard from witnesses including the Biden scion’s ex-wife, Kathleen Buhle; his ex-girlfriend, Zoe Kestan; and from his sister-in-law-turned-lover Hallie Biden, who was married to Hunter’s brother Beau until he died of brain cancer in 2015.
Buhle testified about discovering Hunter used crack the same year as Beau’s death, when she found her then-husband’s pipe on the porch of their Washington, DC home. She said that when he used he was “not himself,” and was “angry [and] short-tempered.”
Kestan told jurors about dating Hunter for roughly nine months in 2018, a wild period during which she got a front row seat to him smoking crack “every 20 minutes or so.”
Hallie testified about finding the gun inside Hunter’s Ford Raptor pickup on Oct. 23, 2018 — 11 days after he bought it — and throwing the weapon away in a panic at a Wilmington grocery store.
Moments later, Hallie recounted, Hunter flew into a rage upon learning she got rid of the .38 and ordered her to retrieve it.
But when she returned to the store roughly 30 minutes later, the gun was no longer there. (It was later found and turned in by an elderly man who had been searching the trash for recyclables.)
Hunter’s defense team, led by attorney Abbe Lowell, told jurors that their client didn’t knowingly lie on the gun application form but rather argued he was in a “deep state of denial” about his drug dependency.
Lowell further described Gordon Cleveland, the salesman at the StarQuest Shooters & Survival Supply, as a “whale hunter” who pushed Hunter into buying the weapon.
The defense also tried to poke holes in the prosecution’s timeline of Hunter’s addiction in an attempt to show he hadn’t fallen off of the drug wagon, but was instead struggling with alcoholism.
Hunter had pleaded not guilty to all charges in the case, although in June 2023 he was slated to take a guilty plea — only for the deal with prosecutors to blow up in court after Hunter’s team discovered he wouldn’t receive blanket immunity from possible future charges.

Court Sentences Miss Chiamaka Ifezue To Death for Killing Make-Up Artist In Enugu,https://thenigerialawyer.com/court-sentences-miss-chiamaka-ifezue-to-death-for-killing-make-up-artist-in-enugu/,TheNigeriaLawyer,"An  Enugu State High Court, sitting in  Enugu, has sentenced, Chiamaka Ifezue to death by hanging for killing an Enugu-based make-up artist, Ijeoma Nweke.
The court, presided over by Justice Kenneth Okpe, in a two-hour judgement on Wednesday, found the accused, Chiamaka Ifezue, guilty of killing the victim by forcing her to drink a poisonous substance.
The corpse of the make-up artist was found in Maryland within Enugu Metropolis on Monday, November 16, 2020.
The deceased, Nweke had left home on Wednesday, 11 November, for a job but went missing afterwards.
Her supposed client, having refused to disclose the location of the job, asked the deceased to stop at the  Enugu State Broadcasting Service (ESBS) Bus Stop, where she would then be taken to the venue.
Nweke, having perceived foul play, sent the client’s phone number to her brother via text.
Her phones were unreachable after hours leading to suspicion that she might have been kidnapped.
This led to a frantic search for her by friends and relatives until early on Monday morning when her corpse was found in Maryland in  Enugu.
Eyewitnesses said that her corpse was mutilated with a substance suspected to be acid.
While delivering the judgment, Justice Okpe, said every piece of evidence pointed to the fact that the convict, lured the deceased to her house where she poisoned the deceased and evacuated her body out of her house.

‘Vice President’s Wife Rejected ADC Because She Wants Former One’,https://thenigerialawyer.com/viice-presidents-wife-rejected-adc-because-she-wants-former-one/,TheNigeriaLawyer,"Amid claims that Nana Shettima, wife of Vice President, rejected a female Aide-De-Camp (ADC) assigned to her,  a former aspirant for the post of the national youth leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Ameen Amshi, explained why.
Recall that a news report making rounds on social media alleged that the vice president’s wife had rejected the orderly, stating that she is very beautiful and single at the time same.
However, Our correspondent could not ascertain when the lady was assigned to the vice president’s wife.
But reacting to the claims in a statement shared via Twitter handle on Sunday, Amshi claimed Nana only turned down the orderly because she preferred her former ADC who served her during her husband’s reign as Borno State governor.
“It is important to correct the news of the alleged rejection of a female police ADC by HE Nana Shettima, Vice President’s wife, during her inauguration. The news has been circulating on social media, but it is not accurate,” Amshi tweeted.
He continued: “Assigning security details or aides to VIPs follows specific procedures that vary across security agencies. It is a process that involves selecting at least three competent personnel and scrutinizing their service records. The most suitable candidate is then presented to the VVIP/VIP for approval, and upon acceptance, the personnel is officially assigned to the individual.
“It’s worth noting that HE Nana Shettima is not new to the corridors of power and has previously worked with an ADC when she served as the governor’s wife for eight years in Borno. Therefore, the same ADC who worked with her in Borno as the governor’s wife was present at her inauguration.
“The Shettima family is known for maintaining long-term relationships with their staff and workers, like retaining the security details that served the Vice President when he was Governor. Given this track record, it’s unlikely that his wife would act differently, and she has always prioritized following due process in her official dealings, including assigning security personnel to VIPs and VVIPs.”

Dissatisfied with the High Court order, the brothers approached the appellate court in separate appeals, praying that the order be set aside.

According to Arthur Eze, Olisaebuka Eze, in connivance with his brother Nnadozie Eze, stole money that ran into billions of naira and millions of dollars, which they used to acquire properties in Abuja and Enugu.

Upon conclusion of investigations, the Commission arrested Olisaebuka Eze and his brother, Nnadozie Eze, and froze their bank accounts following court orders.

In an attempt to challenge the actions taken against them, the respondents filed a suit at the FCT High Court, Apo, before Justice S.B. Belgore, seeking the enforcement of their fundamental rights.

At the end of the hearing, Justice Belgore held that the Commission had violated the fundamental rights of the respondents and awarded N10 million in damages in their favor. The Commission, through its counsel, Buba, challenged the ruling in the Court of Appeal, which overturned the decision of the lower court and held that the detention of the respondents by the Commission and the freezing of their accounts were for the purpose of investigation and were properly backed by court orders.


The appellate court further awarded N500,000 against the respondents in favor of the EFCC."
"Again, Two Lawyers & Businessman Accused Of Forgery, Property Damage Shun Arraignment; Court Adjourns For Restorative Justice",https://thenigerialawyer.com/again-two-lawyers-court-adjourns-for-restorative-justice/,TheNigeriaLawyer,"Again, the two lawyers and a businessman charged with conspiracy to commit forgery and willful damage to property in suit marked LD/23611C/2024 before Justice S.I. Sonaike of the  Lagos High Court, TBS, have failed to appear for arraignment.
The two lawyers, Ademola Owolabi, the managing partner of Ademola Adetokunbo & Co., and Adebayo Akeju, who is a partner in a law firm called Adon Partners,  Lagos, as well as a real estate developer, Alex Ochonogor, are facing the charges pressed against them by the Department of Public Prosecution of the Lagos State Ministry of Justice.
Ochonogor is the owner and managing director of Bluecrest Homes Limited, where Owolabi is also the company secretary.
As a result of their consistent absence and the intervention of the state attorney general, Lawal Pedro (SAN), the court has adjourned the matter to October 21, 2024, to enable the suspects to explore restorative justice.
The suspects were billed to be arraigned on April 8, 2024, but they failed to appear. According to the DPP, Dr. Babajide Martins, Akeju was served the charge, while the other two were evading service.
Consequently, the court adjourned to April 29 for the arraignment. On April 29, they also did not appear. Before that date, one of the suspects, Akeju, petitioned the  Lagos AG, claiming that the arraignment was meant to embarrass him and the others and urged him to suspend the trial, pending a thorough review of the circumstances that resulted in the charge.
This claim by Akeju was promptly refuted by the complainant, who wrote to the AG, explaining in detail the cause of action, the circumstances resulting in the discreet investigation carried out by the police, and the sound opinion of the DPP that the suspects have a prima facie case to answer in court.
Notwithstanding, the matter was further adjourned to June 10. Again, the suspects did not show up. So, the matter was adjourned to explore the possibility of restorative justice as proposed by the office of the Attorney General.
The suspects are facing a five-count charge bordering on the alleged fraudulent acts. The statement of offence in count one says: “Conspiracy to commit a felony to wit: Forgery contrary to Section 411 of the Criminal Law, Ch.C17, Vol.3, Laws of  Lagos State, 2015.”
Particulars of offence state: “Ademola Owolabi (M), Adebayo Akeju (M), Alex Ochonogor (M) and others (now at large) sometime in 2015 at B604, Safe Court Apartments, Ikate, Lekki,  Lagos State, in the Lagos Judicial Division conspired among yourselves to commit a felony to wit: Forgery.”
In count 2, they were charged with forgery contrary to Section 365 (1) of the Criminal Law, Ch. C17, Vol.3, Laws of Lagos State, 2015.
“Ademola Owolabi (M), Adebayo Akeju (M), Alex Ochonogor (M) and others (now at large) sometime in 2015 at B604, Safe Court Apartments, Ikate, Lekki, Lagos State, in the  Lagos Judicial Division with intent that it be acted upon as genuine did forge an affidavit of loss of certificate of occupancy purportedly sworn at the Registry of Ministry of Justice, Alausa,  Lagos State on the 23rd day of September, 2014, to falsely indicate that the original of Certificate of Occupancy Number 36/36/1994W issued to one Hamza Al-Mustapha got missing.
Also, contrary to Section 365 (1) of the Criminal Law, Ch.C17, Vol.3, Laws of Lagos State, 2015, the suspects were accused of forging a Demolition Notice Number 0000025 titled “Audit of Illegal Structures within Government Schemes Acquisition and Revocation Areas” purportedly issued by the Governor’s Office, Lands Bureau, Directorate of Land Regularisation, Secretariat, Alausa, with the intent for it to be acted upon.
They were also accused of procuring a forged Memorandum of Loss of Certificate of Occupancy purportedly dated September 25, 2014, to falsely indicate that the original of Certificate of Occupancy Number 36/36/1994W issued to one Hamza Al-Mustapha got missing as well as willfully and unlawfully destroying a bungalow located on Plot 10, Block 133, Lekki Peninsular Residential Scheme 1,  Lagos State, the property of one Dr. Obidigwe Eze, who resides abroad.
The background to the charge is that Owolabi and Akeju, both lawyers, materially aided Ochonogor, a businessman, in dispossessing Dr. Eze of his property known as Plot 10 Block 133, Lekki Penninsula Residential Scheme 1,  Lagos State.
USP Communications Limited sold the land to Dr. Eze on May 12, 2005, where he erected a bungalow and has been in peaceful possession.
Upon the invasion of the property by the accused persons for land grabbing purposes, the police waded in and investigated the root of their title.
The investigation revealed that Owolabi and Akeju had forged a series of documents to establish that the property still belonged to Major Hamza Al-Mustapha, who was the original allottee, but has since sold the property in 2002 to Continental Properties, who in turn sold to USP Communications, which finally sold to the current owner, Dr. Eze.
Relying on the premise of alleged missing title documents to the land, Akeju allegedly approached Major Hamza Al-Mustapha, while still in prison, on the basis of assisting him in facilitating the sale of the property to Ochonogor, who had indicated interest in purchasing the land and provided funding for all the false documentation, forgeries, and demolition of Dr. Eze’s home.
Al-Mustapha reportedly informed Akeju that he had sold a property in that location, instructing him to confirm from his lawyer, Abdulfatai Thomas, to ensure that the property was not the same he had sold, but the suspect did not contact Thomas as instructed.
He went ahead to concoct documents, demolished Dr. Eze’s home, and sold the land to Ochonogor, who immediately began construction against a court injunction to stop.

Ugochinyere Calls For Suspension Of Gagdi Over Alleged Misrepresentation Of Lawmakers’ Visit To Rivers State,https://thenigerialawyer.com/ugochinyere-calls-for-suspension-of-gagdi-over-alleged-misrepresentation-of-lawmakers-visit-to-rivers-state/,TheNigeriaLawyer,"The spokesman for a group of 60 opposition lawmakers in the House of Representatives, Hon. Ikenga Imo Ugochinyere, on Tuesday, June 11, accused his colleague, Hon. Yusuf Adamu Gagdi, of spreading falsehood during a plenary session.
Raising a matter of privilege, Ugochinyere requested that the House enforce the provisions of the Legislative House Privileges Act on Hon. Gagdi, which could include suspending him from the House among other punishments.
Hon. Gagdi had informed the House that Ugochinyere led some members on a politically motivated solidarity visit to the governor of Rivers state, under the guise of representing the House of Representatives.
He alleged that, despite being aware of an oversight visit by the House Committee on Local Content to Rivers State, Ugochinyere misrepresented the visit to the media as a solidarity visit to the Rivers Governor, as reported by a national newspaper.
However, Ugochinyere said he led a group of 40 “Like Minded” lawmakers to attend a thanks service by the Rivers Governor in their personal capacities and not in the name or on behalf of the House.
He said the members who attended the thanksgiving service were not members of the House committee on local content, adding that the Plateau lawmaker engaged in spreading falsehood on the floor of the House.
Ruling on the matter, Speaker Abbas Tajudeen said the leadership will look into the matter, adding that whenever he is invited, he should gladly honour the invitation with his statement.

Landmark CEO: FG yet to consult us on Lagos-Calabar highway project,https://www.thecable.ng/landmark-ceo-fg-yet-to-officially-consult-us-on-lagos-calabar-highway-project/#google_vignette,TheCable,"Paul Onwuanibe, chief  executive officer (CEO) of Landmark Africa Group, says government has not formally contacted the resort on the impact the construction of the Lagos-Calabar highway would have on its business. 
On Wednesday, some employees of the resort staged a protest to show their disapproval, after the federal government began sand filling of the beachfront for the construction of the coastal highway. 
The 700-kilometre Lagos-Calabar coastal highway is expected to run through the shoreline of the beach resort in Lagos, while traversing eight other states. 
Addressing the development on Thursday in a statement issued by Elsie Ogianyo, brand and corporate communications manager of Landmark, Onwuanibe said “till date, Landmark has never been officially consulted on the coastal highway alignment nor have we been engaged in discussions with regards to the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) of the project on Landmark”. 
“The accelerated sand filling on the Landmark shoreline has sent widespread panic and fear to the independent businesses, suppliers, employees, investors, financiers, and clients that all conduct business within the Landmark Ecosystem,” the statement reads. 
The CEO also said a rerouting of the project should have been considered by government.
“Along the original 1.5km coastal road route which passes through the Water Corporation Road median, there are no permanent structures whatsoever. This original alignment remains unused, undeveloped and available till date for the development of the coastal highway,” the statement reads.
“We feel that rerouting back to this original alignment is one of the several, credible win-win solutions that exist that will also avoid disruption to the beach.
“Of the 80+ businesses that make up the Landmark Ecosystem, over half of them are situated on the Landmark Beach directly in the right of way of the coastal road.
“These businesses have invested between NGN15-20 billion on their businesses in addition to the NGN25 billion that Landmark has invested in the underlying infrastructure.”
The statement said over 12,000 Nigerians are directly and indirectly employed by Landmark, and that their “livelihoods would be greatly jeopardised if the beach is demolished”.
“As we continue to pursue dialogue with officials at all levels of the government, we are sure to receive a formal notification with regard to a timeline for the potential resolution of this matter to quell the fears and uncertainty felt throughout our community,” the statement adds. 
On April 11, Dave Umahi, minister of works, said the road construction will not affect Landmark’s facilities, adding that the project’s corridor has been reduced to 50 meters.
Umahi said only the shoreline could be lost.

Landmark employees protest as FG begins sand filling for Lagos-Calabar highway,https://www.thecable.ng/landmark-employees-protest-as-fg-begins-sand-filling-for-lagos-calabar-highway/amp//,TheCable,"Some employees of the Landmark Beach Resort in the Oniru area of  Lagos commenced a protest on Wednesday as the federal government begins the sand filling of the beachfront for the construction of the coastal highway. 
Scores of employees at the beach resort carried placards with inscriptions ‘#SaveLandmarkBeachResort’ and ‘Save Our Jobs’, and chanted songs of dissent in unison. 
The 700-kilometre Lagos-Calabar coastal highway is expected to run through nine states and would have a railroad running through the middle.
Earlier this month, Dave Umahi, minister of works, said the project will not affect the Landmark facilities, adding that the project’s corridor has been reduced to 50 meters and only the shoreline could be lost.
“What could be lost is the shoreline and people that go to play at the shoreline, but his (Landmark CEO) facilities are all intact because we reduced the corridor to 50 meters. I saw it, there is no permanent structure, other than a few shanties along that shoreline that would be affected,” Umahi said in an interview on Arise Television.
“So I told him no single job will be lost because all his distance is very much intact. There is no single one of them that is to be demolished.”
In an interview with Arise Television on April 7, Paul Onwuanibe, the chief executive officer of Landmark Africa, said the original plan for the coastal highway did not include the beachfront.
The businessman who obtained the land in 2007 said “the alignment was changed so that instead of it running on the land side of Landmark, it is going to run on the beach side”.
“So that is where this issue came up is that the alignment was changed. Our request is simply to go back to the original alignment, nothing is wrong with it,” he added. 
“Now they are looking to put the road on the beachfront and just immediately after Landmark it turns and goes back to its original alignment.
“Going back to the original alignment saves our business and saves the government a lot of money.”
In a series of posts on X, Onwuanibe described the highway as a “laudable project that should enhance tourism rather than destroy it”, adding that the management of Landmark is in “active talks” with the state and federal governments.
He said the government has assured him that there would be no disruption to his business and “a small number of other minor reroutes may be required to sustain the existing socioeconomic activity along the course of this road”.
Meanwhile, Atiku Abubakar, former vice-president, had accused President Bola Tinubu of placing his personal business interest ahead of Nigerians with the coastal highway project.
The former presidential candidate added that the project will lead to a loss of over 12,000 direct and indirect jobs and over $200 million in investments.

Atiku: Tinubu prioritised personal business interests with Lagos-Calabar highway project,https://www.thecable.ng/atiku-tinubu-prioritised-personal-business-interests-with-lagos-calabar-highway-project/,TheCable,"Atiku Abubakar, former vice-president, says President Bola Tinubu placed his personal business interest ahead of Nigerians with the Lagos-Calabar coastal highway project.
Abubakar said the 700-kilometre (km) Lagos-Calabar coastal highway project was awarded to Hitech Construction Company Limited (Hitech), owned by Gilbert Chagoury.
He spoke in a statement signed by Paul Ibe, his media adviser, on Sunday.
Abubakar, who said Tinubu’s administration has inadvertently revealed its penchant for “dubious and shady deals” through the project, described Chagoury as “Tinubu’s business partner”.
“More curious is the fact that the entire pilot phase of this project begins and ends in  Lagos, especially within the axis of Bola Tinubu’s business interests. It is no secret that both Tinubu and Chagoury are business partners,” Abubakar said.
“This same Hitech, owned by Chagoury, was unable to complete the 50km Lekki-Epe Expressway. Despite installing two tollgates along the axis, Hitech which was part of the Lekki Concession Company (LCC) consortium was only able to construct about 20km, forcing the  Lagos State Government to buy it back at the cost of N7.5 billion ($50 million at the time) in 2013 which came at a loss to the people of Lagos.
“Tinubu has once again put his personal business interest ahead of that of the Nigerian people in violation of his oath of office where he swore that “I will not allow my personal interest to influence my official conduct or my official decisions”.
FROM ZERO COST TO N15.7 TRILLION
Abubakar also estimated the Lagos-Calabar coastal highway project could cost the federal government “N15.7 trillion”.
He said the estimate is based on the N1.06 trillion earmarked for 47.47 kilometres (km) (pilot phase) of the coastal highway by Dave Umahi, minister of works.
“But if 47.47km costs about N1.06tn, it means each kilometre is being built at N22.5 billion or $18 million. For a project that is going to be 700km, it means the total cost could be N15.7 trillion or $12.56 billion, which is higher than previous estimates,” he said.
Abubakar said Umahi, in September 2023, had assured the project would not cost Nigeria a penny after the project was awarded to Hitech Construction Company Limited, revealing the agreement between the company and the federal government was a public-private partnership (PPP).
He said Hitech would build, operate and transfer, meaning after operating it for some years and recouping its investment through tollgates, the company will hand over to the Nigerian government.
Umahi, on September 23, 2023, had said the company had already found the money needed to finance the project, however, Abubakar said in March 2024, the minister returned to federal executive council (FEC) with a memo, seeking the approval of N1.06 trillion that would be paid to Chagoury’s firm for the first phase of the project which is wholly in  Lagos.
“Umahi refused to reveal how much the project would cost. He only explained that it would run through nine states and would have a rail road running through the middle. Most importantly, the works minister said the project would come at zero cost to Nigeria, which is currently facing an all-time high level of debt,” he said.
“The works minister even stated, “Let me announce that it is under public-private partnership. The Hitech group are going to look for the money. They have already found the money, and that is the good news because we don’t waste our time talking and holding meetings and wasting resources.”
Abubakar said because the project did not require public funds, it did not go through approval from the national assembly, which holds the power of appropriation.


Also, Abubakar said the project only went through the Infrastructure Concession Regulatory Commission (ICRC) with no record of competitive bidding because Hitech was to fund the project 100 percent.

“This pilot phase was to begin from the edge of Chagoury’s Eko Atlantic City on Ahmadu Bello Way, Victoria Island, and terminate at the Lekki Deep Sea Port, Ibeju-Lekki, a distance of 47.47km. Till date, the Tinubu administration has refused to reveal how much the project will cost in total. Umahi, who even came on Channels Television recently, evaded questions as to the total cost of the project,” he said.

ESTIMATE HIGHER THAN TOTAL COST AGREED BY PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATIONS

Abubakar condemned the federal government for not disclosing the total cost of the project as done by Goodluck Jonathan and Muhammadu Buhari’s administrations, saying it has been shrouded in secrecy.

He said Tinubu’s administration has significantly increased the cost of the project, from $11.97 billion negotiated by Jonathan’s government with China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation (CCECC) and the $11.1 billion later agreed on after Buhari’s administration renegotiated.

“This project returned to public discourse at the twilight of the Goodluck Jonathan administration in November 2014 wherein it was announced President Jonathan had signed the 10-state, 22-station project with China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation (CCECC) at a cost of $11.97bn,” Abubakar said.

“However, former President Jonathan could not begin the project before he lost the election. But his successor, former President Muhammadu Buhari expressed his intention to begin it and announced in 2016 that the project had been renegotiated downward by $800m to $11.1bn and that it would be ready within three years. But it continued to stall.

“In August 2021, while Buhari was on vacation, it was announced by then Information Minister, Lai Mohammed, that the FEC had “approved the memo for the ratification of the president’s approval for the award” of the $11.1 billion project, and that it would be completed in six years. But nothing was done.”

FEAR OF JOB LOSS, PROJECT ABANDONMENT

In the statement, Abubakar said the project is expected to lead to loss of jobs, citing a possible demolition of Landmark Beach Resort in Oniru,  Lagos state.

“It is curious that the terms of such an audacious project continues to be shrouded in secrecy. Worse still, it is expected to lead to job losses like the demolition of Landmark Beach Resort in Oniru which will lead to the loss of over 12,000 direct and indirect jobs and over $200m in investments according to its management,” Abubakar said.

Speaking further, the former vice-president said there are also fears that the project will never get to  Calabar because the pilot phase from Eko Atlantic to Lekki Deep Sea Port was initially conceived as a  Lagos state government project, but the federal government is now implementing it under the guise of the Lagos-Calabar coastal highway.

“The so-called pilot phase from Eko Atlantic to Lekki Deep Sea Port was initially conceived as a  Lagos State Government project but because of its huge cost coupled with the fact that Lagos State has a huge debt burden no thanks to Tinubu, the Federal Government is now implementing it under the guise of Lagos-Calabar Coastal Highway. This perhaps explains why there are fears that the project will never get to  Calabar, and this is the same reason the project is beginning from  Lagos and not  Calabar,” Abubakar said.

Abubakar said Tinubu’s administration is also planning to set up a renewed hope infrastructure development fund (RHIDF) to finance the highway project — despite not revealing the total cost.

“Despite not revealing the cost of this entire project, the Tinubu administration is now on the verge of setting up a so-called Renewed Hope Infrastructure Development Fund, a fund targeted at constructing capital projects without the usual budgeting process,” Abubakar said.

“With a target of N20 trillion or $14.5 billion as seed capital, the fund targets the Lagos-Calabar coastal highway and other projects. The initiative targets Pension Funds, Concessionary Loans, insurance companies, sovereign wealth funds, private sector arms of multilateral development institutions, and bilateral private sector investors, among others, to secure $35bn annually. The Diaspora funding and equity and endowment funds are also expected to play their part in the plan.

“But this renewed hope fund, which will be spent at the discretion of Tinubu and without transparency, will likely become another means of siphoning public funds through shady projects.”

Abubakar said with the current Lagos-Calabar highway project already being handled in secrecy, it remains to be seen how such a fund will be managed.

On March 25, Tinubu approved the creation of the renewed hope infrastructure development fund."
"Lagos-Calabar highway project won’t affect Landmark facilities, says Umahi",https://www.thecable.ng/lagos-calabar-highway-project-wont-affect-landmark-facilities-says-umahi/,TheCable,"Dave Umahi, minister of works, says the Lagos-Calabar coastal highway project will not affect Landmark Beach Resort facilities in Oniru.
Umahi spoke on Thursday during an interview on Arise television monitored by TheCable.
On April 7, Atiku Abubakar, former vice-president, said the project is expected to lead to loss of jobs, citing a possible demolition of Landmark properties.
Abubakar, quoting the Landmark management, said the demolition would lead to the loss of over 12,000 direct and indirect jobs and over $200 million in investments.
Speaking during the interview, Umahi denied claims that jobs would be lost, noting that Landmark facilities are intact.
“I went to see Landmark yesterday. I had to tour that shoreline and it is not the only one that is involved,” the minister said.
“I just went there to understand something: His Excellency said that 12,000 jobs will be lost and I told Landmark that by what we are doing, no job will be lost.
“What could be lost is the shoreline and people that go to play at the shoreline, but his facilities are all intact because we reduced the corridor to 50 meters. I saw it, there is no permanent structure, other than a few shanties along that shoreline that is affected.
“So I told him no single job will be lost because all his distance is very much intact. There is no single of them that is to be demolished.”
Umahi said a recent supreme court ruling granted ownership rights of the land extending 250 meters from the shoreline to the federal government.
In another interview on TVC on April 10, Umahi had said Landmark was not authorised to construct the beach, adding that the company took advantage of the available space and annexed the shoreline which belongs to the federal government.
The minister also said about 80 percent of the first 1.3 kilometres of the project is completed.
“We did not call it Calabar-Lagos coastal road. We call it Lagos-Calabar coastal road, which means that there is a zero point, we have channel zero, and the channel zero happens to be at Ahmadu Bello way and it coincides with Eko Atlantic,” he said.
“So, I have started the project at channel zero, which is Ahmadu Bello and it is progressing. As at today, I can tell you that about 80% of the first 1.3 kilometer is completed.”
The 700-kilometre (km) Lagos-Calabar coastal highway project will cost N4 billion per kilometre, according to Umahi.

"Umahi counters Atiku’s claim, says Lagos-Calabar highway costs N4bn per kilometre — NOT N22bn",https://www.thecable.ng/umahi-counters-atikus-claim-says-lagos-calabar-highway-costs-n4bn-per-kilometre-not-n22bn/,TheCable,"The federal government says the 700-kilometre (km) Lagos-Calabar coastal highway project will cost N4 billion per kilometre. 
Dave Umahi, minister of works, spoke on Wednesday during an interview with TVC.
In a statement on April 7, Atiku Abubakar, former vice-president, estimated the Lagos-Calabar coastal highway project could cost the federal government “N15.7 trillion” — putting the approximation of each kilometre being built at N22.5 billion. 
He said the estimate is based on the N1.06 trillion earmarked for 47.47 kilometres (km) (pilot phase) of the coastal highway by Umahi.
Speaking on the claim, Umahi said the cost of the project is lower than the estimated figure by Abubakar.
“You will find out that our cost is N4 billion per kilometre, instead of the N8 billion per kilometre,” he said. 
He said the coastal road has a total of 10 lanes and also has 23 shoulders.
Shoulder, also known as breakdown lane, is located by the verge on the outer side of a road, used for emergence stop.
“So, when you put the total concrete pavement we are doing, it is about 59. When you put the flexible pavements that was quoted, it is about 23 meters,” the minister said.
“And so, when you run the figures, you will now find out that under his calculation, it is giving over 19 percent per kilometre. Now, divide it by the 22 kilometres that they are doing, it is about 2.225 times a standard superhighway carriageway, which is 11.55. 
“Whereas, what we are doing, if you divide it, it will be 5.167. When you now divide using our N1.067 trillion, you will get N4 billion per kilometer. 
“If you go back to what he has quoted, you will get over N8 billion. So, using concrete, which should be more expensive because of the kind of terrain we have and using flexible pavement, which shouldn’t stand on the coastal road, you will find out that our cost is N4 billion per kilometre, instead of the N8 billion per kilometre.” 
He said the cost has reduced despite the government’s current plan being an upgraded version of the road.
‘FG TO PAY COUNTERPART FUNDING’
Umahi said the project was never envisaged by the present administration to be under public-private partnership (PPP).
“It has  always been an engineering procurement construction (EPC) plan+finance,” he said.
“And so, under this kind of arrangement, like you have Abuja to Markudi, it is EPC+F, the federal government is required to pay certain counterpart funding. 
“And so, in this particular project of Abuja to Markudi, which is being handled by China Harbour, the federal government paid 50/15 percent counterpart funding. Then, you have also Markudi to 9th mile in Enugu state. And they are also paying 15 percent counterpart funding.” 
He said the project has always been under EPC+F, and is to be constructed by the Hi-Tech Construction Company. 
Umahi added that there will be a negotiated counterpart funding of between 15 and 30 percent, to be funded by the federal government.

"Umahi unveils plan for Lagos-Calabar coastal highway, says funding is through PPP",https://www.thecable.ng/umahi-unveils-plan-for-lagos-calabar-coastal-highway-says-funding-is-through-ppp/,TheCable,"David Umahi, the minister of works, has unveiled the plan for the construction of the Lagos-Calabar coastal highway.
In a press conference with journalists on Saturday, the minister also said Hitech Construction will fund the project under the Public-Private Partnership (PPP) model.
Hitech is a division of the Chagoury Group, a business conglomerate in Lagos that oversaw the construction of the Lekki-Epe expressway and the Ajah flyover.
Umahi said upon completion, the highway will have multiple spurs that will connect major towns and cities, including a spur connecting Ogoja-Ikom-Cameroon road.
“There will be a spur that will connect the proposed fourth mainland bridge in Lagos,” he said.
“It is also connected to the deep sea port road being constructed by Hitech, under the concrete technology and it is also connected at Lagos-Badagry to the proposed Lagos-Abidjan super highway.”
He said there will also be multiple connections with roads that lead to the northern parts of the country.
“There is a proposal for connection to Sokoto. I think about four to five connections to northern Nigeria,” he said.
Umahi added that the project is the brainchild of President Bola Tinubu, who has asked him to “fast track this project because it is going to be a catalyst towards the economic development of this country”.
“Let me announce that it is under PPP. The Hitech group are going to look for the money. They have already found the money and that is the good news because we don’t waste our time talking and holding meetings and wasting resources,” he said. 
“We are engaging seriously because we have seen the financial capacity and capability of Hitech and this project is going to be delivered in phases.
“Any section that we complete, we will toll it and then business and transportation will start.
“The right of way of this project is about 100 meter corridor. There is provision for a rail line in the middle of the road which is about 20 meters.
“The road has four carriageways. Each of the service lanes is 10 meters wide. The main carriageway is 14 meters.”

Tinubu creates renewed hope infrastructure development fund,https://www.thecable.ng/tinubu-creates-renewed-hope-infrastructure-development-fund/,TheCable,"President Bola Tinubu on Monday approved the creation of the renewed hope infrastructure development fund (RHIDF).
In a statement, Ajuri Ngelale, presidential spokesperson, said the fund will facilitate effective infrastructure development across the pivotal areas of agriculture, transportation, ports, aviation, energy, healthcare, and education.
Ngelale said the fund will invest in critical national projects that will, among other things, promote growth, enhance local value-addition, create employment opportunities, and stimulate technological innovation and exports.
He added that the fund will raise financing through equity investments, budgetary allocations, special purpose vehicles (SPV), public-private partnerships (PPPs) and multilateral development financing.
Ngelale said Tinubu also directed that the presidential infrastructure development fund (PIDF), a brain child of the Buhari administration, be absorbed into the RHIDF to eliminate administrative inefficiencies.
He noted that the president said projects sponsored under the fund should reflect an equitable national spread to benefit every Nigerian.

Cash-strapped Copia suspends service in Central and Eastern Kenya,https://techcabal.com/2024/06/04/copia-stops-orders-in-six-regions-in-kenya/,Techcabal,"Copia Global, a Kenyan B2C e-commerce platform that allows retailers to shop and restock essential goods using a mobile app or USSD, has stopped taking orders from Central and Eastern Kenya one week after cashflow challenges forced it to go into administration.

The new administrators have cut back on Copia’s markets to preserve cash as it seeks new investors, TechCabal has learned. The six affected markets are Naivasha, Machakos, Meru, Embu, Kericho, and Eldoret. 

The staff working in the depots that serve the affected markets have been sent on leave. On May 16, the company said it would lay off over 1,000 workers. The company has 900 permanent employees and 200 casuals on its payroll. 

Anne Mwihaki, Copia’s director of human resources, told employees via email that the company would inform “all external stakeholders, including agents, customers and transporters.” 

In a separate email, Makenzi Muthusi, one of the administrators appointed by Copia, assured employees that the firm had funds to cover May salaries but delayed the disbursement because they “were unable to complete the administrative tasks relating to the bank accounts.” 

Copia Kenya appointed Muthusi and Julius Ngonga of KPMG, an audit and advisory firm, to help turn around operations and raise fresh capital for the Kenyan unit.

“As a follow-up to our previous communication on the administration process, as a reminder, the objectives of the administration are to maintain the company as a going concern, and the administrators continue to work with management to raise capital from new investors for the Kenya business,” Mwihaki said. 

Copia, once a darling of venture capitalists–including US’s DFC and GoodWell Investments–received $123 million in funding but failed to turn on profit. The company sought to turn informal rural kiosks into a multi-billion digital retail platform linking customers directly to fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) manufacturers to lower product costs. 

At its peak, Copia had 1,800 staff and over 50,000 agents spread across Kenya’s Western, Nyanza, Central, and Eastern regions. In 2022, the firm opened a hub in Uganda but closed after a year, stopping its pan-African expansion ambitions.  "
"Kenya’s Copia mulls shutdown amid plans to lay off over 1,000 staff",https://techcabal.com/2024/05/18/copia-could-shut-down-business/,Techcabal,"Copia Global, a Kenyan B2C e-commerce startup that has raised $123 million in venture funding across seven rounds, is considering laying off employees or shutting down, citing “uncertainties.”

The layoffs, which could affect over 1,000 employees, would be a drastic cost-cutting measure for a company that announced an extension of its Series C round in December 2023. 

”It is important to highlight that uncertainties lie ahead. As a result, it is very likely that there will be a reduction in our workforce and it is possible that the payment of salaries could be at risk,” said Tim Steel, Copia’s CEO, in an internal memo seen by TechCabal.

Steel added that laying off employees would be the first course of action to rein in costs. Should that fail, the company could shut down, joining other Kenyan e-commerce startups that have closed shop since the COVID-19 pandemic, like Wefarm, an agritech startup connecting farmers to farm input distributors, and Zumi, a B2B connecting retailers to suppliers. 

While the startups have blamed funding drought and tough market conditions for their woes, experts suggest that the viability of the business models, absence of industry data to inform expansion, poor infrastructure, and customer trust deficit could be among the factors causing the closures.   

“The company is required, in compliance with the law, to give all staff one (1) month notice of potential redundancies and to undertake a one (1) month consultancy period with all potentially impacted staff. Therefore, all staff are receiving this notice. A notice will also be given to the Labour Officer as required by law,” Steel said.  

Copia is one of Kenya’s most well-funded startups. It announced a $50 million Series C funding round in 2022 and a $20 million extension of the same round in December 2023. 

Despite Copia claiming that it had “cracked the nut of last-mile delivery” and built a fulfilment system for customers in remote parts of the country, signs of strain became obvious in 2023 when it laid off over 700 employees and closed Uganda operations barely two years into the market.  

With an economic downturn and tight capital markets, Copia embraced a strategy of optimising operations to maximise its existing resources. This included a 25% workforce reduction that affected 350 employees.

In July 2023, Copia told TechCabal that it planned to remain profitable and better serve customers through streamlined processes and cost reduction. It suspended plans to expand to other African markets, including Nigeria, Ghana, South Africa, and Mozambique, citing the need “to accelerate Copia’s drive to profitability. 

Copia was founded by Tracy Turner and Jonathan Lewis in 2013 to allow customers in remote areas to order goods through its platform and delivered to them through its network of agents."
Copia enters into administration after failing to secure funding,https://techcabal.com/2024/05/24/copia-enters-into-administration-after-failing-to-secure-funding/,Techcabal,"Copia Global, a B2C e-commerce platform and the parent company of Copia Kenya has entered administration one week after a TechCabal report revealed the company was considering shutting down.  The startup has appointed Makenzi Muthusi and Julius Ngonga of KPMG, an audit and advisory firm, to manage the administration process, per a statement shared with TechCabal.

Copia Global, which raised $123 million across eight funding rounds, failed to secure new funding, putting its operations and over 1,000 jobs at stake. The firm said on May 24 that the administrator will work to raise funding for Copia’s Kenyan unit. 

“Copia Global, the parent company of Copia Kenya, was unable to attract capital on terms that were amenable to all existing stakeholders, funders, and investors. Copia Global is now winding down, leaving the Copia Kenya business in a new position to raise capital directly,” Copia said in a statement sent to TechCabal. 

Copia will lay off an unspecified number of employees to “create a position for growth”, the company said. On May 16, Copia’s CEO Tim Steel told employees that over 1,000 staff could be laid off.  

Also as part of the cost-cutting, Copia Kenya will stop physical order processing and replace it with an online fulfillment model through its mobile app. 

“Under the mandate of the Administrator, the Copia Kenya management team will implement a plan with a lower burn rate, an accelerated path to profitability and a focus on the increasingly digital consumer,” said Copia.

Copia was founded by Tracey Turner and Jonathan Lewis in 2013 to allow customers in remote areas to order goods through its platform and delivered to them through its network of agents.

The company said that it was struggling to meet its obligations like paying salaries, forcing it to close shops after 10 years. Signs that the business was straining started to show in 2023. At its peak, the company had 1,800 employees and a network of 50,000 agents in Kenya and Uganda.

In July 2023, Copia cut its operations and laid off 350 staff. Earlier in the year, it had reduced the headcount by 50 employees in what the company called a drive to keep down labour costs while eyeing profitability.

Copia also closed down the Uganda base, barely two years after setting shop in the country, and rolled back its ambitious expansion plan that would have seen the company set shop in Nigeria, Ghana, South Africa, and Mozambique.

Copia joins a growing list of well-funded Kenyan ventures that have closed shop after failing to raise fresh capital like Wefarm, an agritech startup connecting farmers to farm input distributors, and Zumi, a B2B connecting retailers to suppliers. Others like Sendy and iProcure are under administration while Twiga Foods and Markertforce are teetering, hoping for fresh investors’ confidence.

Copia, alongside Twiga Foods ($186 million) is Kenya’s most funded e-commerce platform.

The shutdown is a big blow to Tim Steel, Copia CEO, who took over from the co-founder Tracy Turner in 2017. Steel told a Kenyan newspaper in 2023 that he is dedicated to making Copia a success.

“I think I fear not succeeding with Copia. Not turning it into that billion-dollar company. Having invested so much time, effort, blood, sweat, and tears into it,” Steel told Business Daily in June 2023."

Copia fires 350 employees in third round of layoffs,https://techcabal.com/2023/07/26/copia-lays-off-350-employees/,Techcabal,"Copia, a Kenyan e-commerce platform serving low-income households, has laid off 25% of its 1,800 workforce. The company blamed labour costs and a need to improve profitability for the layoffs. 

Copia, a Kenyan e-commerce platform that serves low-income households, has laid off 25% or 350 members of its workforce. First reported by Techweez, the e-commerce company confirmed the layoffs in a statement to TechCabal. Part of the company’s statement said, “The limited restructuring process will likely impact less than 25% (about 350) of the permanent workforce. The majority of Copia’s employees are not affected by this,” says Copia. In compliance with Kenyan labor laws, the employees will be given a one-month notice and leave Copia before September. “Copia management will decide on the affected staff, who will then be informed of their employment status after one month,” the statement from Copia adds.

It is the third time this year that Copia has trimmed its headcount after it laid off 50 Kenyan workers at the start of the year. In April 2023, Copia closed its Ugandan operations making 300 employees redundant.  In 2023 alone, Copia has sacked 700 people.

What’s driving the layoffs?
In January 2022, Copia raised $50 million in a Series C round. And while the company says its in a good position financially, it claims that the layoffs are a way of reducing labour costs while it keeps its eye on boosting profitability. Copia currently employs 1,800 workers, but the company’s headcount will be 1,450 after today’s redundancies. Employees impacted will receive a severance package and other benefits. 

TechCabal confirmed that regular operations continued despite the layoffs, with Copia claiming that it is “optimising a number of key processes in its operations to enable it become more efficient in serving its Customers and partners.”

Official Copia statement to TechCabal
Given that the economic downturn and the constrained capital markets are likely to continue for some time, Copia is optimising a number of key processes in its operations in Kenya to provide a better service to its customers and to drive sustained operating profitability. These changes require Copia to undergo a limited restructure of its operations.   

While improving our operating model through digital, tech-led initiatives to drive faster profitability, this restructuring process will likely impact less than 25% of the permanent workforce and will be undertaken in full compliance with Kenyan labour law and with sensitivity to all employees affected by the process.   

Copia’s Kenyan operation is rapidly growing, providing e-commerce services to middle income consumers through an unrivaled high-quality, low-cost distribution network of over 50,000 agents. In addition, its service also provides local manufacturers with a unique, efficient route to market.   

This limited restructure process is intended to ensure that during these economically challenging times, we will continue to focus our resources on the critical levers of business success and remain a lean and sustainable business for the long-term. This decision is consistent with many of the best companies in Africa and across the world which are responding to the market environment and prioritizing profit.  

We are committed to working hard to achieve our goals and deliver sustainable profitability faster.  "
"Copia, Kenya’s offline e-commerce king, wants more customers to order from its mobile app",https://techcabal.com/2023/11/15/copia-wants-more-online-orders/,Techcabal,"Copia Global, the Kenyan e-commerce startup that has raised $107m in venture funding across seven funding rounds, is launching a campaign to drive more sales through its mobile app. The company, which currently collects and delivers customer orders through 50,000 agents, is taking advantage of the fact that most low- and medium-income Kenyans now have smartphones.

“We started with an offline experience because our customers were offline, but now we can fully focus on transitioning all to our app,” said Tim Steel, CEO of Copia, in a statement seen by TechCabal. 

Currently, most of  Copia’s two million customers place orders for household items, electronics, or packaged foodstuff in person at neighbourhood shops, via USSD, or even call in orders (via phone) to their local shopkeepers. Copia’s new campaign will focus on helping these users transition to placing orders on its mobile app. “The goal is increased direct engagement with our customers so that they can see all our products and the pricing which is difficult when you are in an offline environment,” Steel told TechCabal on a call.

The company launched a similar campaign last year to help agents use smartphones more, leading to an increase in the use of its agent marketplace app from 5% to 80%. A key driver of success was that Copia offered smartphone financing to its agent network. It will offer the same smartphone financing facility to allow current offline and new customers to purchase smartphones (and higher ticket items) and pay in bits.

Founded in 2013 by Tracey Turner and Jonathan Lewis, Copia relies on a network of 50,000 street shops in small towns and semi-rural areas in Kenya to collect and deliver orders. Increasing app usage will change this model as customers rely less on nearby shops, which double as Copia agents to place orders. These shops will still serve as pickup locations, and shopkeepers will still earn commissions from app orders.

Copia says it can better control the shopping experience, have complete visibility over how customers place orders, and even begin to customise offerings based on a customer’s historical preferences. 

Kenya’s smartphone usage has increased 

More Kenyans now own and use smartphones than ever, and mobile internet packages’ costs have fallen steadily since the early 2010s. A Kantar East Africa study commissioned by Copia said 73% of middle and low-income consumers in Kenya now own smartphones. Per the report, half of Copia customers who currently own smartphones use the internet at least once weekly. Given current trends, more Kenyans will transition to smartphones as prices fall and smartphone financing becomes more accessible. 

“Copia is usually the first commerce app our consumers experience, so we have a real responsibility to bring the world to their fingertips,” said Tim Steel. It’s an admission that Copia’s target demographic (rural and peri-urban) are not digital natives and may have difficulty weaning themselves off agents. 

In January 2022, Copia announced a $50 million series C round. This year, the company has cut at least 700 internal roles, in addition to shuttering a recently launched Ugandan business. In addition to its e-commerce business, Copia runs several brand product lines and operates two facilities that produce and package sugar and rice."
Copia shuts down Ugandan operations,https://techcabal.com/2023/04/19/copia-leavesuganda/,Techcabal,"Copia Global is leaving Uganda, TechCabal has learned. The company says its decision is, “consistent with many of the best companies in Africa and across the world which are responding to the market environment and prioritising profit.”
“Given the economic downturn and constrained capital markets are expected to continue for some time, Copia plans to double down on efforts to drive our founding Kenya business to sustainable, scaled profitability,” a company statement reads.
In 2021, Copia set up shop in Uganda, a move which Tracey Turner, Copia Global founder and chair described as “ the next step” in fulfilling the company’s mission to reach Africa’s emerging middle class. “Uganda has one of the fastest growing middle classes in the world with a hard-working population and a dynamic entrepreneurial culture. Copia is designed specifically to serve this high growth but underserved consumer base who want access to high-quality products at the best prices,” Turner had said.
Providing clarification about the decision to leave Uganda, CEO Tim Steel said, “This is the right move for Copia given the market environment,” He says Copia will work hard to reach the point where it can, “restart our Pan African plan.”
“By focusing our resources on our Kenyan business, we can assure short-term profitability and long-term success. This means pausing our international expansion plans, including suspending our Ugandan operation,”  Steel added.
Copia says it has notified its agents and customers in Uganda of its departure and is already paying out outstanding commissions to agents. More than 350 employees will be impacted by Copia’s decision to leave Uganda and double down on Kenya. The firm says affected employees have been provided with a severance package.
Founded in 2012 with operations commencing in 2013,  Copia combines technology and a network of  roughly 40,000 local agents to reach consumers in cities and towns across East Africa. Copia’s aggregation model allows it to pass on reduced prices from its vendor deals to customers. But the firm is also creating its line of branded products and has opened two facilities to package Copia-branded sugar and rice.
Copia has disclosed a total of $103M in funding over 7 rounds according to data from Crunchbase. The latest investment was a $50 million Series C round led by Goodwell Investments which was announced in January 2022.

Nigeria to establish solar PV projects with $1.5 billion loan FG secured in August 2022,https://nairametrics.com/2022/12/19/nigeria-to-establish-solar-pv-projects-with-1-5-billion-loan-fg-secured-in-august-2022/,Nairametrics,"The Federal Government of Nigeria and US-based renewable energy company Sun Africa, have signed an agreement for the engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) of 5,000 MW of solar generation and 2,500 MW/h of battery energy storage power plants.
The power plants will be situated across the country’s six geopolitical zones and will help provide clean and affordable electricity to over 30 million people.  
A statement released by the Federal Government through its official Twitter account noted that the agreement was signed during the US-Africa Business Forum held recently.  
Cost: The Federal Government said the project will be funded with a $10 billion investment from the United States government. 
Part of the funds is a $1.5 billion loan Nigeria obtained from the American export credit agency Exim Bank. Nairametrics gathered that the loan was mobilized by Sun Africa.
 More on the $1.5 billion loan: In August 2022, it was announced that the Federal Government had secured a $1.5 billion loan from the US-Exim Bank to boost solar power infrastructure in 10 different locations in the country. 
For the record: A 2021 solar report on Nigeria, compiled by the Netherlands Enterprise Agency, revealed that Nigeria is one of the fastest-growing markets for solar energy.  
Nigeria has a fairly distributed solar radiation average of 19.8 maximum months of rainfall-modified solar radiation (MJm2/day) 
The report states that the country’s off-grid market for mini-grids and solar home systems is estimated to yield $10 billion annually in revenue and savings of $6 billion for Nigerian homes and businesses.  
The report also highlights the fact that sales of off-grid solar systems (50 – 100W output) increased by more than double in value from $23 million in 2018 to $63 million in 2019. Adding related products, the total import value is closer to $150 million.

World Bank approves $750 million DARES clean energy project in Nigeria ,https://nairametrics.com/2023/12/15/world-bank-approves-750-million-dares-clean-energy-project-in-nigeria/,Nairametrics,"On Thursday, December 14, the World Bank approved the $750 million Distributed Access through Renewable Energy Scale-up (DARES) project in Nigeria.
This is according to a press release seen by Nairametrics. 
According to the press release, $750 million credit from the International Development Association (IDA), is being used to leverage more than $1 billion from private investors and additional funding from different partners.
Contributions include $100 million from the Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet and $200 million from the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA).  
Other collaborators in this initiative include the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the German Development Agency (GIZ), Sustainable Energy for All (SEforAll), and the African Development Bank (AfDB). 
What the initiative hopes to achieve 
This ambitious DARES project aims to provide over 17.5 million Nigerians with better access to electricity through distributed renewable energy solutions. The goal is to tackle the electricity access deficit.  
As of 2021, more than 85 million Nigerians lacked access to reliable electricity. Many households and businesses rely on expensive and environmentally harmful petrol and diesel generators due to the unreliable and insufficient national grid supply. 
To bridge this gap, DARES builds upon the success of the World Bank-financed Nigeria Electrification Project (NEP).
NEP had already made significant strides, establishing 125 mini-grids and selling over a million solar home systems (SHS), benefiting more than 5.5 million Nigerians. Additionally, NEP created over 5,000 local green jobs in Nigeria. 
The new DARES program will assist the Federal Government of Nigeria in coordinating and finance off-grid electrification efforts.
It will also aid states in developing capacity and policies to promote rooftop solar energy.
One of its key focuses is on inclusivity, especially empowering female-headed households and women-led businesses by providing easier access to electricity and increasing women’s employment in the energy sector. 
Shubham Chaudhuri, the World Bank Country Director for Nigeria, emphasized the project’s goal of replacing nearly 280,000 polluting and expensive generator sets, contributing significantly to Nigeria’s energy transition objectives. 
Meanwhile, Adebayo Adelabu, Nigeria’s Minister of Power, noted that this effort would extend access to clean and fair energy to communities that are currently unserved or underserved, promoting empowerment and transformation.

FG to provide solar subsidy in Nigeria through $750 million World Bank loan,https://nairametrics.com/2024/04/11/fg-to-provide-solar-subsidy-in-nigeria-through-750-million-world-bank-loan/,Nairametrics,"The federal government plans to provide subsidy to developers and operators of solar mini-grids in unserved and underserved areas in the country.
The subsidy will be provided through a World Bank approved loan of $750 million under the Distributed Access through Renewable Energy Scale-up (DARES) project.
This was disclosed in the financing agreement for the loan project seen by Nairametrics. The financing agreement for the loan was signed by the Minister of Finance, Wale Edun, on March 31, 2024, and World Bank’s Country Director for Nigeria, Shubham Chaudhuri, on February 19, 2024.
The loan project is fundamentally aimed at augmenting the supply of electricity to both households and micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) through a surge in private sector-led distributed renewable energy initiatives.
The document noted that the loan will be partly used to provide “Support to the development and operation of privately owned and operated solar hybrid mini grids in unserved and underserved areas through: 1.1. Minimum Subsidy Tender Carrying out of Minimum Subsidy Tender processes and provision of Minimum Capital Cost Subsidies to selected developers/operators of: (a) Isolated mini grids; (b) Interconnected mini grids; or (c) Solar rooftop solutions in Participating States.”
Performance-Based Grants
Asides from providing subsidy, the federal government plans to also provide performance-based grants.
The document noted that there will be “Provision of Performance-Based Grants to eligible mini grid operators based on new customer connections for isolated mini grids and percentage of capital expenditures for interconnected mini grid projects.”
The grant will also cover Standalone Solar (SAS) Systems for Households, MSMEs, and Agribusinesses. This grant will provide “Support to the expansion of SAS systems for households, MSMEs, and agribusinesses in rural areas through: 2.1. Performance Based Grants for Standalone Solar Provision of Performance Based Grants (“PBGs”) to eligible companies to rapidly deploy SAS solutions in rural and underserved areas, through supply and demand side support and based on independently verified outputs, and to support deployment of solar productive use of electricity (PUE) equipment to MSMEs, agribusinesses and commercial customers.”
There will also be “Catalytic Grants Provision of Catalytic Grants, on a matching basis, to eligible SAS companies that target the poor, remote, or hardest to reach consumers in the country.”
About the financing
The loan from the World Bank is structured into three distinct segments, cumulatively forming the $750 million total financial package. This package is segmented into credits of $350 million, $250 million, and $150 million, each earmarked for different facets of the project and subject to currency conversions as necessary.
The primary implementers of this project are the Rural Electrification Agency (REA) and the Lagos State Electricity Board (LSEB), with significant support from the Federal Ministry of Power, the Nigerian Electricity Management Services Agency (NEMSA), the Federal Ministry of Environment, the Nigerian Electrification Regulatory Commission (NERC), and the Federal Ministry of Finance.
Alongside varying interest rates, the principal payments will be done as follows:
The project’s loan terms are delineated with a Maximum Commitment Charge Rate of 1/2 of 1% per annum on the unwithdrawn financing balance.

Nigeria Secures $1.5bn Loan From US to Boost Solar Power Infrastructure,https://www.thisdaylive.com/index.php/2022/08/05/nigeria-secures-1-5bn-loan-from-us-to-boost-solar-power-infrastructure/,ThisDay,"Nigeria has secured a $1.5 billion loan from the US-EXIM Bank to boost solar power infrastructure in 10 different locations in the country. Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of SUN Africa LLC, USA, Adam Cortese, disclosed this yesterday while speaking with newsmen after a meeting of a delegation of the company with President Muhammadu Buhari at the State House, Abuja.


Cortese explained that the loan was a government-to-government facility on a concessional rate of over 20 years.
According to him, the Niger Delta Power Holding Company (NDPHC) will own the assets, which he said would not only generate low cost electricity but also enable the company to pay back the loan.


Cortese stated, “Once again, this is government-to-government financing. It’s built upon the success that we’ve had in Angola recently, where we’ve delivered roughly $2.6 billion of solar PV storage and transmission capacity.
“I think the important point to note here is, yes, it’s a government-to-government loan, from the US-EXIM Bank to the government of Nigeria, but it’s being done on a concessional rate; over 20-year tenure, which is extremely attractive.


“What’s unique about this model is that NDPHC is going to own its own assets. So, it’s going to own its own generation base and our project will deliver a low levelised cost of electricity, which will not only allow them to pay back the loan from EXIM Bank, but generate a profit on top of it.”



Speaking while receiving the delegation, Buhari declared that the rapid integration of solar power into the country’s energy mix would lead to an increase in electricity access to underserved and unserved communities.
He said his administration had embarked on several reforms aimed at revitalising Nigeria’s energy sector and improving energy access to communities across the country.


The president commended the interest of the US developer to invest in Nigeria’s power sector, pledging that the federal government would remain committed to collaborating with the private sector in improving energy access, creating jobs, and industrial development.
Highlighting some of the reforms embarked upon by his administration to address Nigeria’s energy need, the president listed the signing of the Nigeria Climate Change Bill in November 2021, implementation of the Power Sector Recovery Programme with the World Bank, and the Nigeria Electrification Programme aimed at enhancing energy access to remote communities.


He added that the Presidential Power Initiative with Siemens was aimed at achieving end-to-end alignment across the electricity value chain.
According to the president, “Initiatives like these will go a long way in developing local capacity through technology transfer and relieving transmission constraints through the generation and distribution of electricity in the local Distribution Companies Franchise Area, making off-take easier.
‘‘The Ministers of Finance and Power as well as other agencies of government will remain available at all times, to ensure the achievement of this significant project as part of our efforts towards achieving Net Zero Emission by 2050.



‘‘I am pleased to note the technology transfer content embedded in this initiative as well as the employment generation potentials.
“I thank you all for coming and look forward to receiving regular updates as you achieve significant milestones in developing your projects in Nigeria.”
Earlier in his remarks, Founder, Sun Africa LLC, USA, Mr Goran Rajsic, said the renewable infrastructure company hoped to deliver solar power in multiple locations across the country, just as it had done in Angola, with financing done through the US EXIM Bank. Rajsic pledged that his organisation, working with other leading energy companies, had the capacity to do what Nigeria required in the area of power.


“We will create something that will be of immediate need for Nigeria, and last for years to come,” Rajsic stated.
He described what Sun Africa LLC, USA had in mind as “a partnership for energy and infrastructure, which will revolutionise both the industrial and agricultural sectors.”


Speaking also at the occasion, Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer, Niger Delta Power Holding Company (NDPHC), Chiedu Ugbo, said the company will utilise the loan facility to provide solar power at 10 sites, starting with five."

"Okupe dumps Labour Party, cites ideological conflict",https://punchng.com/okupe-dumps-labour-party-cites-ideological-conflict/,Punch,"Former Director General of Peter Obi-Datti Presidential Campaign Organisation, Doyin Okupe, has dumped the Labour Party.
In his resignation letter, shared with journalists on Monday, Okupe cited ideological differences post-2023 election as the basis for his departure from the party.
Okupe was in December 2023 convicted by the Federal High Court in Abuja after being prosecuted by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission for money laundering to the tune of N700m.
He was accused of illicitly receiving money from a former National Security Adviser, Sambo Dasuki, from the funds meant for arms procurement.
He was jailed for two years but the judge placed an option of a fine of N13m, which he took and avoided time in prison.
Okupe, a day after his conviction for money laundering, announced his withdrawal from the campaign of Peter Obi, the presidential candidate of the Labour Party, but vowed his support and loyalty to the party’s flagbearer.
He later appealed approached Court of Appeal, seeking the reversal of the money laundering conviction
His lawyer , Joe-Kyari Gadzama (SAN), argued that Okupe received the N700m cash not in his individual capacity but for the Office of the Senior Special Adviser to the President  Goodluck Jonathan on Public Affairs.
He said he acted under the instructions of the ex-President and hence, he should not be penalised unjustly.
In his resignation, Okupe said, “I submit herewith my letter of resignation from the Labour Party with effect from today. You will recall that our flagbearer, Mr Peter Obi, myself, and others left the PDP abruptly and had to look for a special-purpose vehicle in which to contest the 2023 presidential elections.
“The Labour Party, your good self and other members of your executive provided us with this veritable platform with no burdensomeness whatsoever and for which we were extremely grateful.”
He added, “We did contest the election on the platform of the Labour Party and lost. This makes it exceedingly difficult for me to continue to stay in the Labour Party which is ideologically rooted in the left of the centre.
“I have been a rightist and a liberal democrat all my entire life. It is, therefore, this ideological conflict that makes me seek an exit so that I may continue my political activities with liberalism, sincerity and freedom.
“I wish to thank you in particular and other members of the leadership of the party for the cordiality and respect accorded to me as the Director General of the Obi-Datti Presidential Campaign Organisation.”

In a statement on Tuesday, Obiora Ifoh, national publicity secretary of the LP, said there is no room for political opportunists in the party.
Okupe announced his resignation from the opposition party in a letter on Monday.
He said his decision to leave the LP was based on “ideological grounds” and wished the party success in its future endeavours.
In the statement, Ifoh said Okupe’s exit from the party is not surprising, adding that he has a tradition jumping from one party to another.
“The leadership of the Labour Party like most Nigerians read in the social media the purported resignation of the former Director General of our Presidential Campaign Council, Dr. Doyin Okupe from the Labour Party,” Ifoh said.
“His exit from Labour Party is not in any way surprising to us. In a true character of traditional politicians who moves from place to another, he was in PDP, from PDP to APC and then Labour Party and we won’t be surprised if he goes back to his vomit and embrace either APC or PDP all over again. It is all about where food is ready.
“Labour Party is an ideological party, it has a clear-cut ideology which supports equal opportunity and social justice.
“It is specifically not a place for people like Doyin Okupe. Our system in Labour Party does not support political opportunists.
“The system will naturally expose such political characters and eject them. I ask again, had Labour Party declared winner of the presidential election, will Okupe remain with the party or jump ship in adherence to his ideological leaning.
“We must recall that Okupe was forced to abdicate office halfway into the campaign because of the baggages he came with from the other party where he served.
“The courts whipped him into early political menopause, so he really didn’t contribute much into the Labour Party’s success in the 2023 electoral voyage, however we are glad he acknowledged that we offered him shelter.
“Finally, the leadership of the Labour Party wishes him well in his future political adventure. We will however remain positive that a new Nigeria is still possible.”

‘Signal of rebirth’ — Adeleke signs bill adopting new logo for Osun,https://www.thecable.ng/signal-of-rebirth-adeleke-signs-bill-adopting-new-logo-for-osun/,TheCable,"Ademola Adeleke, governor of Osun, has assented to a bill adopting a new logo for the state. 
In March, Adeleke had written to the Osun assembly requesting approval for the change of the state’s logo.
Subsequently, the house of assembly granted Adeleke’s request, replacing the logo initiated by the Rauf Aregbesola administration in 2011, with a new one.
In a statement on Wednesday, Olawale Rasheed, the governor’s spokesperson, said Adeleke described the new logo as “a signal of rebirth” for the state.
“The new logo is also an educational resource material for our younger generation as it contains symbols of our landmarks, strengths, resources and history,” Adeleke said.
“The logo is also a tool to market the state at home and abroad.
“It is my honour and privilege to introduce the new logo as the symbol of our state.
“This announcement will herald a new life of prosperity, abundance and sustainability for our people and admirers.”
On his part, Adewale Egbedun, speaker of the Osun assembly, said the new logo represents the heritage of the people of the state.
In July 2023, the Osun assembly repealed the law validating the public usage of the state’s anthem, crest and flag.
The law, Osun State Anthem, Crest and Flag Law 2012, was instituted during the administration of Aregbesola.

"Osun assembly finally repeals state anthem, crest, flag introduced by Aregbesola",https://www.thecable.ng/osun-assembly-finally-repeals-state-anthem-crest-flag-introduced-by-aregbesola/,TheCable,"The Osun house of assembly has finally repealed the law validating the public usage of the state’s anthem, crest and flag. 
The law, Osun State Anthem, Crest and Flag Law 2012, was instituted during the administration of Rauf Aregbesola.
Adewale Egbedun, Osun house of assembly speaker, said in a statement that repealing the law was in tandem with the ruling of a federal high court in 2017. 
BACKGROUND
The state government, during the administration of Aregbesola, announced the renaming of Osun state as ‘state of Osun’, and introduced a new anthem, crest and flag under a new law. 
On December 14, 2017, an Osun state high court sitting in Ilesa declared that the renaming was illegal and therefore, null and void, while also declaring that the law and its makers were unknown to the 1999 constitution.
During his inaugural speech in November 2022, Ademola Adeleke, the Osun governor, ordered an immediate reversal to ‘Osun state’ instead of ‘state of Osun’. 
A day later, the seventh state house of assembly rejected Adeleke’s order and said the state will continue to be referred to as ‘state of Osun’ as the adoption was “a matter of law”.
OSUN TO RE-ENACT LAW 
The speaker said some appropriate and corrected parts of the repealed law will be inserted into the re-enacted version.
“At plenary yesterday, the Osun state house of assembly repealed the Osun State Anthem, Crest and Flag Law 2012, in compliance with the judgement of a Federal High Court dated 14th December, 2017, on a matter instituted by Hon. Kanmi Ajibola representing Oriade state constituency,” his statement reads. 
“Understanding however, that there may be some aspects of the law that are appropriate, the house agreed that all corrections made on Osun State Anthem, Crest and Flag Law 2012, form part of the bill for Osun State Anthem, Crest and Flag Bill 2023, sponsored by the majority leader.
“In essence, what the house has done, is vacate a law that had already been invalidated by a court of competent jurisdiction, to pave way for a new law that will respect the letters and spirit of the Nigerian constitution that we swore to abide by.”

"Court declares ‘State of Osun’ illegal, says Aregbesola erred",https://www.thecable.ng/court-declares-state-osun-illegal-says-aregbesola-erred/amp/,TheCable,"An Osun state high court sitting in Ilesa has declared that the renaming of Osun state as ‘State of Osun’ by Rauf Aregbesola, governor of the state, is illegal and therefore, null and void.
Yinka Afolabi, the judge, ruled that the law and its makers were unknown to the 1999 Constitution.
In the more than one hour verdict, Afolabi chided Aregbesola for deliberately and singlehandedly renaming the state, contrary to the known norms and the nation’s constitution.
He also declared that the makers of the law, who are currently serving as members of the state house of assembly, were not sworn in as members of the ‘State of Osun House of Assembly’ but as members of Osun state house of assembly going by the seventh schedule of the constitution.
The judge said that since the creation of the state in 1991, previous governments used the constitutionally enshrined name of Osun state.
All the other 35 states of the federation, he added, had not deviated from the constitutional names given to them.
“The executive governor of the state changed the name in 2011. The renaming of a state goes further and deeper for anyone to singlehandedly do,” he held.
“To re-order the name of Osun state as ‘State of Osun’ is hereby declared as illegal, null and void.
“On the oath of allegiance, I want to state that the Seventh Schedule is part of the law.
“It is not a mere draft or mere oath. It does not give room for any alteration. After deposing to an oath of office, you cannot turn around to do otherwise.”
The judge threw out all the arguments by Basiru Ajibola, state attorney-general, who stood in as counsel for the governor and the state government.
He, however, granted all the seven prayers of the plaintiff.
The case was instituted by Kanmi Ajibola, a human rights activist, who had challenged the legality of the ‘State of Osun Land Use Charge Law’.
Ajibola had gone to court in 2016, asking for certain reliefs after being served a notice by a private company known as “Interspatial Limited.”
The notice was christened ‘State of Osun Land Use Charge Annual Demand Notice’ and signed by one Ogunlumade, permanent secretary in the ministry of finance.
According to him, the notice was addressed to him as the property owner of No. 42, Onigbogi Street off Ibala, Ilesa west, and served on August 15, 2016.

He spoke on Sunday during his inauguration as governor, in Osogbo, the capital of the state.
Adeleke, who is a former senator representing Osun west, was elected governor on July 17.
Speaking at the inauguration ceremony, he alleged that his predecessor, Gboyega Oyetola, frustrated plans on ensuring a smooth handover to him.
He said since July 17, Oyetola took decisions that did not follow due process and were not in the best interest of the state.
“My good people of Osun, since you elected me as your governor on July 16, 2022, which the Independent National Electoral Commission announced on July 17, 2022, the former governor, alhaji Isiaka Gboyega Oyetola, maliciously started putting roadblocks to make things difficult and almost impossible for the new administration to serve you,” he said.
“Mass employment was carried out without budgetary provisions for salary payments for the new employees, even when the state was struggling to pay salaries and deliver other services.
“Various hurried and criminally backdated contracts were awarded and again without budgetary provisions. Appointments of several obas were hurriedly done without following due process, just to mention a few.
“All efforts to get the governor to set up a transition committee and submit handover notes in line with best practices proved abortive.
“It is, therefore, my desire to ask for your patience and understanding to give my administration a few weeks to review and sort out all the actions and malicious confusions which the immediate past administration has created since July 17, 2022.
“Those actions were indeed vindictive measures against the people of Osun state for voting them out of office.
“Consequently, I hereby issue the following directives which will be backed up with appropriate executive orders:
“Immediate freezing of all government accounts in banks and other financial institutions.
“Immediate establishment of a panel to carry out an inventory and recover all government assets.
“An immediate establishment of a panel to review all appointments and major decisions of the immediate past administration taken after July 17, 2022.
“An immediate reversal to the constitutionally recognised name of our state, Osun state. All government insignia, correspondences and signages should henceforth reflect Osun state rather than state of Osun which is unknown to the Nigerian constitution.”
The state government, under the administration of Rauf Aregbesola, had announced the renaming of Osun state as “state of Osun” in 2011.
But in 2017, an Osun state high court sitting in Ilesa declared that the renaming is illegal and therefore, null and void.
Speaking further on Sunday, the governor said he is aware of his responsibilities which involve meeting the expectations of the people.
“Therefore, I promise that those expectations of the workers, traders, artisans, farmers, business owners, students, pensioners, traditional and religious leaders, and indeed, all residents of Osun state will be met by the grace of God and the cooperation of everyone,” he said.
“Under my watch as the governor of Osun state, I will boldly correct all past injustice, corrupt acts or policies by any previous administration which are against the collective interest of our people.
“Your governor will be a people’s governor. I will be accessible, responsive, consultative, and proactive in handling small and big matters of state governance.
“I know that as a product of the collective will of you my people, there is a heavy weight of history on my shoulders and I accept the urgency of your expectations, the depth of your aspirations, and your conviction in me to build a better state.”

Speaking when he received President Patrice Talon of Benin Republic at the State House in Abuja, on Wednesday, President Tinubu said Nigeria and Benin Republic share a lot in common, describing both countries as conjoined twins held together at the hip.

“We are one. No other nation like ours should be worried. What is affecting us is a lack of synergy. We have not developed the necessary economic synergy that will develop our two nations. We must have common economic principles and priorities. The economic programme you are developing through inter-ministerial collaboration is welcomed by me.

“We will support all of our private sector interests to facilitate prosperity in both of our important countries. I appreciate the urgency of your approach, and we welcome this. Leadership is sometimes defined by urgent action. Thank you for your quality leadership. We are together. I am not a backward looking person. I look forward. This is how I avoid missing steps,” the President said.

President Talon, who was at the State House to seek the support of President Tinubu on improving trade relations, ahead of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) Summit, described the relationship between his country and Nigeria as crucial.

He said Benin Republic is seeking stronger trade ties with Nigeria, emphasizing the free movement of people and goods between both countries.

“Benin has started implementing a national development plan which includes enhanced integration between Nigeria and Benin Republic. Our development plan includes taking into account what investments are required in Benin to enhance our integration with Nigeria in trade terms. It is true that many agreements have been signed to push our integration forward, but they have not been implemented.

“At the level of ECOWAS, we embrace free movement and integration, and at the African level, AfCFTA envisages this; so we need to move urgently to make this a reality.

“Our investment programme must be revised to factor in all factors of the Nigerian economy. We seek to set up an inter-ministerial technical committee that will jointly prepare a draft document for our legislatures. I am ready to sign an executive order to appoint members of the council to advance mutually beneficial cooperation across sectors.

“There have been difficulties bilaterally on the issue of smuggling. We will work hard to coordinate and ensure that your interests are protected as we integrate our economies. I want us to make history together,” President Talon said.

The Lagos State Commissioner of Police, CP Idowu Owohunwa, declared this while speaking at a press briefing held at the state command headquarters in Ikeja, Lagos, on Friday, October 6, 2023.
Owohunwa also disclosed that a total of 26 persons, including members of Mohbad's family, had been questioned in connection with his death.
The budding artist died on September 12 at the age of 27. The circumstances surrounding his death had caused controversies on social media, leading to calls for investigations by the police.
Shortly after his death and suspicious burial, old videos of his alleged bullying and physical assault surfaced online.
“Five suspects have so far been identified, arrested, detained, and interrogated on their alleged roles in the sequence of events that led to the death of the singer,” the Commissioner of Police said on Friday.
He added that the auxiliary nurse administered “multiple and highly potent” injections to Mohbad shortly before his death.
Owohunwa revealed that the injections, consisting of Tetanus Toxoid, paracetamol, and Cetrazone — an antibiotic — were administered at Mobad’s residence on September 12.
“At about 14:35hrs of 12th September 2023, Miss Feyisayo eventually arrived. Armed with one pack of Ceftriaxone injection, one paracetamol injection and syringes,” he said.
According to the police boss, the medications triggered an immediate reaction, including vomiting, goosebumps and convulsions.
“Miss Feyisayo administered the drugs on Mohbad and he started vomiting, while goosebumps appeared on his face, Mohbad was reacting to the administered medications,” Owohunwa added.
The Police Commissioner also stated that Mohbad's friend, Ayobami Sodiq, aka Spending, was the one who invited the nurse to the singer's residence, where the three injections were administered

The singer died on September 12, 2023, and was surprisingly buried the next day without the necessary rites usually accorded deceased celebrities of his status.
Following Mohbad's death, videos proving his harassment and maltreatment in the hands of his former record label surfaced on the internet, which led to suspicions of foul play.
In one of such videos, he asked Nigerians to hold his former boss, Naira Marley, responsible if he ever died.
Though the late singer's father, Joseph Aloba, explained that Mohbad was quickly buried because of Yoruba customs, Nigerians insisted that an autopsy and investigation must be carried out to establish the cause of his death.
This made the Nigerian police swing into action by setting up an investigative team to get to the root of the matter.

Mohbad’s sympathisers dispersed with teargas at Lekki tollgate after procession,https://www.pulse.ng/news/local/mohbads-sympathisers-dispersed-with-teargas-at-tollgate-after-procession/302g268,Pulse,"Many fans of the late Afrobeat singer, Ilerioluwa Aloba, who trooped out on Thursday, September 21, 2023, for the candlelight procession in memory of the singer were allegedly dispersed with tear gas.
The candlelight procession was held at Muri Okunola park in Victoria Island around 8 pm.
But after the procession ended, sympathisers who proceeded to the Lekki tollgate were dispersed with teargas around 11 pm.
In a video shared on Twitter, a popular skit maker, Oluwadolaz, claimed, “We have been dispersed with teargas…”
Another video showed one of the sympathisers being helped to safety by fellow sympathisers with his right leg covered in blood. The injured sympathiser was allegedly shot at by the police.
However, many Nigerians have questioned why the sympathisers converged at the Lekki tollgate, the site of the October 20, 2020, #EndSARS, where soldiers shut peaceful protesters.
Reacting to the issue, a popular On-Air Personality, Do2dtun in a post on his X handle confirmed that the procession ended at 8 pm.
Wondering why the sympathisers moved to the #EndSARS site, Do2dtun, who anchored the tribute concert held in honour of Mohbad at Muri Okunola park said the event was a candlelight procession, not a protest.
“Honesty over Honesty Nigerians do not listen. WE DO THE MOST. This procession ended at Muri Okunola Park over 3 hours ago. We ended and all left. Some still went to converge at the Lekki toll gate. It is not a protest. It is a CANDLELIGHT PROCESSION,” he said.
In another post, the OAP while blaming the police for allegedly firing tear gas at the sympathisers said the sympathisers too should have applied common sense because the procession could have been hijacked and turned into something else.
""It’s not a right for the police to do that but people hijack these things & turn it to something else. Muri okunola was approved & it was a peaceful candle procession. it’s just common sense. The people that went home, are they stupid? Apply this thing sometimes. Na Lagos we dey,"" he said.
Commenting on the matter, the Force Public Relations Officer, Force Headquarters, Prince Olumuyiwa Adejobi resisted the urge to describe the procession as a protest.
“I am not against candlelight procession, I don’t want to call it a protest, I call it a procession, even police can do a procession to honour somebody. It is to honour the dead and pray for his soul,” he said.
The candlelight procession was organised by the management of the late singer.
